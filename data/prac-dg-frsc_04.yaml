    be safeguarded from contamination. Preventing any intentional or unintentional

- en: If the evidence is seen to be tainted in some way, then its admissibility is
    questionable. Not unreasonably, it should, as a matter of course, be challenged
    because it is possibly unreliable and its authenticity is in serious doubt. In
    criminal cases, where there is doubt about evidence, the jury would clearly be
    placed in a difficult position trying to unravel the truth and determine the reliability
    of a questionable exhibit. In such circumstances, the judge may well direct that
    the benefit of the doubt be given to the defendant. The value of the exhibit is
    therefore diminished and the judge may have it struck out as being inadmissible.
    This is highlighted in the case studies later in this chapter.

    It is critical to observe the rules of collection and the chain of custody of
    the evidence by ensuring that the recovered evidence was not contaminated. This
    includes ensuring that the evidence was not altered between its acquisition and
    its presentation in legal proceedings and even before its acquisition by the practitioner.

- en: Obviously, the case can collapse if it can be shown or there is some suspicion
    that there has been a break in the chain of custody. On occasion, the judge may
    direct that the evidence is inadmissible, but alternatively may also permit the
    jury to make a decision on its admissibility while considering its evidentiary
    value. Therefore, it is important to show that the chain of custody is unbroken;
    otherwise, the court may disallow it if it were to be challenged by the opposing
    legal team. The completeness and accuracy of the evidence logging of the chain
    of custody enhances the court's willingness to accept assurances as to the authenticity
    of digital evidence. Consequently, it is crucial that the chain of custody adhere
    to approved legal standards.

    Just like blood samples or fingerprints, which may easily be contaminated at the

    unless strict procedures are followed. The storage and safekeeping of physical
    records, such as witness statements, crime scene photographs, facsimiles of manuscripts,
    and so forth, require prudent record-keeping and safe custody, thus facilitating

    of the evidence in pristine condition. In traditional crime scenes, it is not
    uncommon for the scene to be disturbed by those who make discovery of it. Disturbance
    by extreme weather conditions, such as fire, heat, wind, rain, and water, as well
    as animals, insects, and bacteria can also alter the state of the evidence. This
    leaves the forensics examiner with the challenge of trying to preserve the remains

    some form of offense or impropriety is discovered by an organization's personnel,

    and collect what they consider to be vital evidence may in effect contaminate
    and render such evidence inadmissible at worse and altered so as to diminish the
    weight of the evidence at best. Without some sound forensic training in evidence
    recovery and initial management of suspected transgressions, this will remain

    a timeline of key events to support any hypothesis or counter-argument as to the
    nature of a transgression that, wherever possible, the practitioner should try
    to corroborate each evidence object against other information or at least show
    some correlation between two events. If there is any indication that the evidence
    has been tampered with before, during, or even after the recovery process, this

    of it are often left in what is termed file slack, which may facilitate some memory
    recovery. This is a phenomenon of Windows operating systems, which dictate the
    length of each file saved on a hard drive. Because most files vary in size and
    a percentage of clusters in each allocated cluster or file space is not occupied
    by the file, the sector is filled with clusters called **RAM slack**. The computer
    may pack this free space with a random series of data from the computer memory,
    which may be recoverable and provide some useful evidence from recent and old
    RAM events. In the event that more drive sectors are needed during file storage,
    drive slack is used and is padded with remnants of deleted data. Both drive and
    RAM slack may hold remnants of memory, providing logon names and passwords as
    well as other potentially useful information. Recovering this may include advanced

    for active connections and identify legitimate ports from those that may indicate
    a hacker attack. For the inexperienced practitioner facing this form of recovery,
    they will often be confronted with a significant number of unidentified open ports,
    which may be legitimate or can be exploited as a backdoor attack. Therefore, it

- en: The next section presents two Australian case studies that stress the importance
    of maintaining the highest professional standards when recovering digital evidence
    and emphasizes the importance of evidence preservation. They beg the question
    as to why law enforcement agencies over-rely on specialist digital forensic units
    rather than providing some sound basic digital para-forensic training and more
    effective tools for rank-and-file officers, for it is they who are often the first
    respondents at crime scenes that are increasingly involving computing devices
    of some form or other.

- en: 'Sometimes, when challenges to admissibility occur during legal proceedings,
    digital evidence may be inappropriately passed to the jury for it to adjudicate
    because of a failure of the judge to understand the nature of the evidence and
    the argument on which the challenge is based. This was epitomized in the case
    of indecent possession of child pornography in the jury trial of Mowday versus
    the State of Western Australia (2007). The case illustrated the failure of the
    trial judge to reject digital evidence where serious doubts on the antecedents
    about its safekeeping were raised by the defense lawyer at the commencement of
    the trial. Consequently, during the appeal proceedings, the digital evidence in
    the Mowday case was rejected as being invalid and specific convictions were reversed.

    picture files were located on the defendant's laptop by a computer technician
    tasked previously by the defendant to upgrade the device and remove suspected
    malware. In the process of upgrading the computer with new memory chips, the operating
    system was deleted and the defendant's personal data was saved to the technician's
    backup computer. After defragmenting the hard drive, the operating system was
    reinstalled on the laptop and the defendant's personal data was copied on to the
    laptop. No special forensic tools were used to copy, remove, and later restore
    this personal data to the laptop.

    to depict child pornography. Local police were notified of a possible offence,
    visited the workshop, and directed the technician to copy the data to a DVD, which
    was duly handed to the police officers. On police instructions, personal data
    was restored to the laptop and it was then returned to the defendant for later
    seizure. Subsequently, the police officers lost the DVD.

    while awaiting the arrival of the correct memory chip. Other technicians had access
    to the room where the laptop was casually stored, yet no attempt was made by the
    police team to seize the laptop and preserve the evidence. This very fact led
    to the case being challenged on the grounds that no chain of custody was in place
    prior to the laptop being seized some considerable time later during a raid on
    the defendant's residence by a specialist computer team.

  zh: 这台笔记本电脑在技术员的办公室里放了几周，等待正确的内存芯片到货。其他技术员可以进入存放笔记本的房间，但警察团队并没有尝试在笔记本电脑被扣押之前就取走它并保存证据。正是这个事实导致案件被挑战，理由是笔记本电脑在被扣押之前并未建立起有效的物证链，而是在一个相当长时间后通过专门的计算机团队在被告的住所进行突击搜查时才被扣押。

    possession cases, there is a reversal of the presumption of proof of innocence,

    or offensive material. It seems incredulous that the evidence was regarded as
    admissible when in fact its authenticity seemed in doubt—a view shared by the

    was a partial admission of guilt by the defendant during a video interview.

- en: Such lack of professionalism in digital forensic investigations is regrettably
    not uncommon. Information that is intended to form part of court proceedings or
    information that could conceivably be used as evidence must be handled carefully
