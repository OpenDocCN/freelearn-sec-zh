- en: The purpose of this book is to provide you with a clear understanding of digital
    forensics from its relatively recent emergence as a subdiscipline of forensics
    to its rapidly growing importance alongside the more established forensic disciplines.
    This chapter will enable you to gain a clear understanding of the role of digital
    forensic practitioners and the cybercrime and corporate environments, where they
    are actively seeking evidence of crimes and civil offences. A small sample of
    case studies of digital crime scenes will enable you to understand the complexity
    typical of many cases and the challenges posed to the forensic practitioner.

- en: During the past 10 years or so, there has been a growing interest in digital
    forensics as a part of tertiary courses and as a career path in law enforcement
    and corporate investigations. New technologies and forensic processes have developed
    to meet the growing number of cases relying on digital evidence. However, it has
    been apparent that the increasing complexity, size, and number of cases is creating
    problems for practitioners, who also face resource and costing restrictions as
    well as a shortage of well-trained, experienced personnel. The book will describe
    these challenges and offer some solutions that have helped me in my practice and
    research endeavors, and which will hopefully assist and empower current and prospective
    practitioners to manage problems more effectively in the future.

    profession can rapidly dissipate because of the tedium and heavy caseloads, notwithstanding
    the inherently exciting and important nature of the work. What will be shared
    with you are new and more effective ways of reducing tedium and time wastage,

    Bertillon's novel photographic records of crime scenes and his precise cataloging
    and measurement of corpses provided the foundation for the forensic science relating

    action of an individual cannot occur without leaving a mark," or, more succinctly,
    "Every contact leaves a trace." *Inman and Rudin* (2001, p. 44) more meaningfully
    assert that no one can act with the force that the criminal act requires without
    leaving behind numerous signs of it: either the wrongdoer has left signs at the
    scene of the crime or, on the other hand, has taken away with him—on his person
    or clothes—indications of where he has been or what he has done.'

    have been used on Chinese legal documents for centuries as a proof of identity
    and the authenticity of the documents. However, it was not until the end of the
    nineteenth century that Edward Henry devised a workable classification system
    and implemented it in India in 1897, publishing his book, *Classification and
    Uses of Fingerprints*, in 1900\. The following year, Henry's classification was
    introduced to the London Metropolitan Police; later that year, it was fully functional
    at the Fingerprint Office at New Scotland Yard, with the first court conviction
    by fingerprint evidence being obtained in 1902.

    of Fingerprints）*。第二年，亨利的分类系统被引入伦敦大都会警察局；同年晚些时候，它在新苏格兰场的指纹办公室得到了全面实施，1902年通过指纹证据获得了首宗法院定罪。
- en: However, the reliability of fingerprint evidence has recently been challenged
    in a number of jurisdictions, with concerns over the lack of valid standards for
    evaluating whether two prints match. No uniform process exists for determining
    a sound basis for confirming identification based on fingerprint examinations.
    Some examiners rely on counting the number of similar ridge characteristics on
    the prints, but there is no fixed requirement about the number of points of similarity,
    and this varies significantly in different jurisdictions. Some courts in the USA
    have gone as far as to state that fingerprint identification is not based on sound
    forensic science principles. Similar criticism about the lack of standardization
    and scientific research has been directed at digital forensics, a far newer discipline.

    It tells little else. It does not always tell when the person was there, nor does
    it guarantee that the person was there—only that their DNA was found to be there.
    It does not tell us what they were doing if it is established that they were in

    However, in my experience, there is no real distinction between criminal and civil
    examinations when using digital forensics. Each group is looking for the same
    sort of evidence but arguably to different standards. The e-discovery is almost
    entirely a civil matter as it involves disputes between different organizations,
    so the concept of evidence is slightly different. I contend that the approach
    used in the past for e-discovery typically involved a large number of machines,
    and it can be applied to digital forensics with some refinements as the only way
    to handle large data volumes. [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. The Need for Enhanced

    verification of other evidence as circumstances dictate. It is often a tedious
    process, and frequently, an inordinate amount of time and resources is required

    and provide an accurate interpretation of the evidence.

    in the digital forensic process should pass the acceptable "reasonableness test",
    meaning that all possible effort shouldn't be put into finding all conceivable
    trace evidence and then seizing and analyzing it. This is especially becoming
    more challenging to practitioners as the volume of data to be analyzed becomes
    enormous and crosses over many networks. In my casework, it is evident that in
    practice, a gap exists between what is theoretically possible and what is necessary
    to complete an examination. While in theory there may be a desire to complete
    analysis of every byte of data, there is rarely any justification in doing so.

- en: This chapter outlined the nature of forensics, provided a potted history of
    the development of digital forensics, and defined its purpose in light of more
    established forensic disciplines. An outline was presented of its value in public
    and private investigations and the rise and nature of cybercrime. The role of
    digital forensic practitioners, the skills and experience required, and the challenges
    they face were provided along with some case studies of digital forensic crime
    scenes to highlight the topic. The chapter provided not only a brief insight into
    the challenges the discipline faces but also some solutions to better manage them
    through enhanced forensic processes and tools that are emerging. Finally, the
    chapter endeavored to share some basic ideas for those of you considering becoming
    a practitioner, which you will hopefully find insightful and constructive.

    in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. The Nature and Special Properties of Digital
    Evidence"), *The Nature and Special Properties of Digital Evidence*. Understanding
    the qualities of digital evidence, and indeed its vagaries, is essential groundwork
    for practitioners. Digital evidence can provide a rich treasure chest of clues
    about a transgression. A clue may be considered a mistake by another name, and
    finding and interpreting them is what really adds to the excitement of a forensic
    examination. Analyzing digital evidence can be rewarding, disappointing, and often
