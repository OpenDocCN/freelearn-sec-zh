- en: By the beginning of the twenty-first century, more than half of criminal cases
    involved a computing device of some description, and the trend has continued and
    is likely to rise. Its use in legal cases too has grown and shows no sign of diminishing.
    Digital evidence is derived from the examination of a wide range of digital devices
    and shares similar characteristics with other forms of evidence. There are some
    differences that enhance evidence recovery analysis, but, as will be seen in this
    book, there are characteristics that also make it challenging for practitioners.

- en: Digital evidence is information in digital form found on a wide range of computer
    devices; in fact, it is anything that has a microchip or has been processed by
    one and then stored on other media. Digital data is a numerical representation
    that is usually in binary form, as distinct from electronic data stored in analog
    form. It has been alleged that an Australian narcotics trafficker concealed a
    spreadsheet of his customers and transactions inside a microchip implanted in
    his pet dog. It was uncovered when a canny police officer queried the presence
    of a microchip implant gun, readily available online for a modest cost, in the
    suspect's premises. This discovery prompted minor surgery on the dog to remove
    the tag, which was later found to contain the incriminating information in the
    form of a spreadsheet containing a list of narcotics dealers and transactions.

- en: Evidence tendered in legal cases, such as criminal trials, is classified as
    witness testimony or direct evidence, or indirect evidence in the form of an object,
    such as physical documents, the property owned by persons, and so forth. Evidence
    in electronic form, including digital and analog data, is defined as real evidence
    and sometimes as documentary evidence. It has also been referred to as IT evidence,
    electronic evidence, or computer evidence. Digital evidence includes e-mails,
    electronic documents, spreadsheets, databases, system logs, and audio, picture,
    and video files, amongst others. The most common form of evidence presented to
    courts is spoken word by practitioners when providing interpretations of digital
    evidence.

- en: Evidence in legal cases is used to prove (or refute) facts that are in dispute
    as well as proving the plausibility of disputed facts—most notably, circumstantial
    evidence or indirect evidence. Digital evidence, just like documentary evidence,
    provides inferences that may assist in proving some key fact of the case. It helps
    investigators and legal teams develop reliable hypotheses or theories as to the
    perpetrator of a crime. Its usefulness is apparent in establishing a link between
    a crime, the victim, and the perpetrator of that crime. The reliability of the
    evidence is paramount to supporting or refuting any hypothesis put forward as
    to the involvement of possible suspects. We will look at this more in [Chapter

- en: Digital evidence can take many forms depending on the circumstances of each
    case and the devices from which the evidence is recovered. In the past, the most
    common recoveries have been from desktop and laptop computers and network servers.
    Digital evidence collected assists in both criminal and civil cases and, on occasion,
    may be the only evidence tendered. Recovery from desktop and laptop computers
    was generally performed by physically removing the hard drive from the source
    device and connecting it to the practitioner's computer. To prevent or minimize
    contamination of the suspect's source device, we can use a hardware device called
    a **write blocker** on the suspect's device so as to copy data potentially holding
    evidence. The use of hardware and software write-blocking tools and processes
    is described in detail in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving
    Digital Evidence"), *Recovering and Preserving Digital Evidence*.

- en: The imaging process is intended to copy all blocks of data from the suspect's
    to the practitioner's target device. This is sometimes referred to as a physical
    copy of all data, as distinct from a logical copy, which will only copy what a
    user would normally see. Logical copies do not capture all the data, and the process
    will alter some file metadata to the extent that its forensic value is greatly
    diminished, resulting in possible legal challenge by the opposing legal team.
    Therefore, a full bit-for-bit copy is the preferred forensic process. The file
    created on the target device is called a **forensic image file** and various formats
    are available, including `.AFF`, `.ASB`, `.E01`, and `.dd` or raw image files,
    and virtual image formats such as `.VMDK` and `.VDI`.

    percent of documents are stored in digital format. This creates significant difficulties
    in detecting any alteration to the data, requiring practitioners to link transgressors

    of evidence. This sounds fine in theory, but often pieces of evidence are missing

    is critical in making a valid reconstruction of key events. The timestamps on
    all digital devices are an automated system that can often be adjusted manually.
    Laptop and desktop computers, for example, need to have the computer clock set
    when the device is first commissioned for use. Computer clocks are notoriously
    unreliable at sound timekeeping and require automatic synchronization with a reliable
    online service such as the **National Institute of Standards and Technology**
    (**NIST**). If the device has not been used for some time or there is no automatic
    synchronization, then it is more than likely that the computer clock has been
    running slow or fast. This discrepancy can increase exponentially and make the
    logs of file events unreliable. Some clocks may be running an hour faster or slower
    and, in some cases, this may be in terms of days or even years.

- en: Proving the authenticity and correctness of digital evidence is a constant requirement
    in legal cases to determine its evidentiary worth. Taken at face value, there
    is a danger that digital evidence has sufficient evidentiary weight, and some
    form of corroboration helps add to its value. For example, the operating system
    may create some instability that may skew evidence, such as the accuracy of file
    timestamps or identifying user access, leaving it to be misinterpreted.

- en: 'Documentary evidence may also provide corroboration in support of specific
    digital evidence. For example, the evidence of an incriminating document being
    created on a work computer and then printed may show which user account created
    the document because of a microdot identifier on the printed document. This would
    be especially helpful if the electronic records of the printer and the computer
    were unclear as to the history of the document, printer spool records often being
    overwritten and difficult to interpret conclusively. Such processes, including
    microprinting, are commonly used to prevent and detect forgery of computer-created
    documents. The following site provides some recent developments in such security

  zh: 文献证据也可以为特定的数字证据提供佐证。例如，罪证文件是在工作计算机上创建并打印的证据，可能显示是哪个用户帐户创建了该文件，因为打印文件上有微点标识符。如果打印机和计算机的电子记录对于该文件的历史记录不明确，打印机的缓存记录往往被覆盖且难以确凿解读，这将尤为有帮助。这类过程，包括微打印，通常用于防止和检测计算机创建文件的伪造。以下网站提供了此类安全保护的最新发展：

    separation bonus assisted by the company accountant. The employee e-mailed the
    accountant to seek the CEO's approval requesting that the bonus be backdated to
    a time prior to the takeover of the company by a new owner. The letter of approval
    tendered to obtain payment was backdated but not received and paid to the employee
    until after the takeover by the new owner, who believed that it was a pre-takeover
    arrangement. What later attracted the attention of the new owner was the large
    amount of the bonus. Further inquiry revealed that the e-mail records between
    the employee and the accountant were deleted from the employee's computer, in
    itself thought a highly suspicious act by the new owners.

  zh: 考虑一个近期的案例，一名离职员工与公司会计师合谋伪造了50,000美元的离职奖金。该员工通过电子邮件联系会计师，寻求首席执行官的批准，要求将奖金追溯至公司被新老板收购之前的某个时间。为了获得支付，提交的批准信件虽然被追溯日期，但直到新老板收购公司之后才收到并支付给该员工，新老板认为这是一项收购前的安排。后来，新老板注意到奖金金额过大。进一步调查发现，员工与会计师之间的电子邮件记录已从员工的计算机中删除，这一行为本身被新老板认为是极其可疑的。
- en: Fortunately, the e-mails were recovered from the e-mail server, but no record
    of the creation of the letter approving the bonus was located on the accountant's
    or CEO's computers. Using forensic tools, the e-mails were partially recovered
    from the employee's computer and the bonus attachment was recovered from a deleted
    e-mail backup file (`.OST`). Staff members who had tried to piece together the
    e-mails on the two computers did so without any formal forensic knowledge and
    altered several related documents that had been attached to the incriminating
    e-mails. The last accessed and modified dates had been inadvertently altered,
    preventing a fuller reconstruction of user access to the documents.

- en: This case exemplifies the value of file content and metadata, but it also demonstrates
    the vulnerability of the data to deliberate and unintentional human action resulting
    in evidence contamination. Had the fraudster had the wit and opportunity to delete
    e-mails while still synchronized to the e-mail server, those records too would
    have been erased and not necessarily recovered. This also shows the need to ensure
    that e-mail servers keep a full record of all e-mail messages, even those deleted
    by users. A backup of the e-mail stores for defined periods is often a legislative
    requirement of government organizations. In many countries, this is mandatory
    for public companies, as enacted in the US under the far-reaching provisions of
    the Sarbannes-Oxley Act of 2002.

- en: This chapter defined digital evidence and explained its evidentiary value and
    the conditions it must satisfy to be admissible in legal proceedings. The special
    characteristics of digital evidence were described, showing its great value but
    also the problems in using it because of its often-complex technical characteristics.
    The special role of the practitioner to analyze and explain digital evidence to
    the layperson and the legal fraternity was emphasized.
