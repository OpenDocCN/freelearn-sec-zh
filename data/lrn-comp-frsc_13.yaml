    about his education, experience, and credentials. At his arrest, defense teams
    had hired him for five other pending matters. He also provided expert testimony
    in state and federal courts over 50 times. The prosecutors determined that the
    educational degrees Kwitowski claimed to have received did not exist, nor was
    there any record he had completed the professional certifications he claimed.
    Kwitowski claimed to have worked with NASA, but the organization denied any involvement
    or work history with Kwitowski. Kwitowski also had a criminal record dating back
    nearly 20 years that included battery, domestic violence, and aggravated battery
    with a deadly weapon.

  zh: 这份道德规范包含了明确的语言，说明了被认证为**认证计算机检查员**（**CCE**）的成员在组织内允许或不允许做的事情。无论是成员还是非成员，在进行数字取证检查时都应遵循此行为规范。
- en: Maintaining a code of ethics in your professional life allows you to keep your
    objectivity during the investigation. If you cannot be impartial, you should not
    be a party to the investigation. I recently took part in a motion hearing to determine
    whether they should appoint me as an expert. After they questioned me about my
    qualifications, education, and experience, I was asked my opinion about the state
    of the evidence I had reviewed. On cross-examination, the prosecution told me,
    “*Your duty as an expert is to find things wrong in the evidence.*” My reply was
    that as an expert, my job was to see whether I could recreate the examination
    and achieve the same results and conclusion. If the information I found was detrimental
    to the theory supported by the defense or the prosecution, I would disclose it
    no matter which side of the matter I was appointed to represent. With digital
    forensics, the data is the data; there is not a lot of interpretation about what
    the data means.

  zh: 在职业生涯中保持道德规范能够帮助你在调查过程中保持客观性。如果你无法保持公正，就不应参与调查。我最近参加了一个动议听证会，目的是决定是否任命我为专家。在他们询问我的资格、教育背景和经验后，接着问我对我所审查证据的状态的看法。在交叉审问中，控方告诉我：“*作为专家，你的职责是发现证据中的错误。*”我的回答是，作为专家，我的工作是查看是否能够重现检查过程并得出相同的结果和结论。如果我发现的信息对辩方或控方支持的理论不利，我会披露它，无论我被任命代表哪一方。对于数字取证，数据就是数据；对于数据意味着什么，不需要做过多解释。

    certifications. The possession of certifications does not guarantee or make you
    an exceptional digital forensic investigator.

  zh: 随着培训和经验的积累，我建议你获得行业特定的认证。拥有认证并不意味着你就是一名出色的数字取证调查员。
- en: A certification states that you have met the minimum standards of that organization.
    It does not mean you cannot make a mistake or come to the wrong conclusion. It
    also ensures that you are keeping current with the changes in the field. What
    was acceptable 5 years ago may not be acceptable now because of changes in technology
    or the law. Your training never stops as you pursue a career in this field.

  zh: 认证表明你已经达到了该组织的最低标准。这并不意味着你不会犯错或得出错误的结论。它还确保你在跟进行业内的变化。五年前可以接受的标准，可能因为技术或法律的变化，现在已经不可接受了。在这个领域发展职业生涯时，你的培训永远不会停止。
- en: Ethics is doing the right thing when no one is looking. If you compromise your
    ethics, you can negatively affect your career and investigation. Remember that
    your goal is to be unbiased and present the facts of the matter to the fact-finder.
    You are not an advocate for either side of the matter and you now have the knowledge
    to accomplish that goal.

  zh: 伦理是指在无人监督时仍能做出正确的选择。如果你妥协了自己的伦理，可能会对你的职业生涯和调查产生负面影响。记住，你的目标是保持公正，向事实发现者呈现事实。你不是任何一方的拥护者，而你现在具备了实现这一目标的知识。
