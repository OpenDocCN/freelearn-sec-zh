- en: To explain, let me take you on my personal career journey. I graduated from
    college with a dual major in political science and communication, and an ambition
    to attend law school. I was accepted into law school and had obtained a scholarship
    for tuition and fees, but I was burdened financially from my undergraduate work
    and was also concerned about food, housing, healthcare, and so on. I made a decision
    to pursue a career rather than attend law school. Jobs in Northern Utah were scarce
    in the late 1980s for a graduate who didn't have a directly applicable degree,
    that is, one in accounting or medicine, and I ultimately moved to the Los Angeles
    area. I had one short-term position as an executive assistant in a medical firm,
    and then found my calling in technology.

  zh: 为了说明这一点，让我带你回顾一下我的个人职业历程。我大学毕业时主修政治学和传播学，并有志于上法学院。我被法学院录取并获得了学费和费用的奖学金，但我由于本科时的经济负担，且对食物、住房、医疗等方面感到担忧，最终决定放弃法学院，选择追求一份职业。1980年代末，北犹他州对没有直接应用专业（如会计或医学）学位的毕业生而言，工作机会十分稀缺，我最终搬到了洛杉矶地区。我曾在一家医疗公司做过一段时间的行政助理，随后找到了我在科技领域的真正兴趣。
- en: 'My calling came by way of a newspaper ad for a floor salesperson at a wage
    of $17,000 USD per annum. I knew a bit about computers—as in, I could use one—and
    I knew I could talk to people, so a career was born. I attended every vendor training
    available and was diligent in studying and developing my skills. I was fortunate
    to have two early career mentors who encouraged my success and taught me everything
    they knew. I took on assignments related to operations, sales, network architecture
    and installation, computer repair, storage, partner engagement, customer engagement,
    and so on. I learned and absorbed all I could. At the time, mainframes and mini-computers
    dominated the industry, and PCs and client-servers were becoming a thing. Storage
    systems were massive near-line devices, and the biggest concern for a CIO was
    a rogue phone line in a data center. There were very few formal CISO positions,
    and security folks were generally of two types: investigators and network professionals.
    I entered security somewhat accidentally, but according to a plan.'

  zh: 我的职业起点来自一则报纸广告，广告内容是招聘一名地面销售员，年薪为17,000美元。我对计算机略知一二——能使用计算机——而且我知道自己能与人沟通，因此我的职业生涯由此开始。我参加了所有可用的供应商培训，并且在学习和发展我的技能方面非常勤奋。我很幸运有两位早期的职业导师，他们鼓励我的成功，并教会我他们所知道的一切。我承担了与运营、销售、网络架构与安装、计算机维修、存储、合作伙伴关系、客户关系等相关的任务。我学到了很多，吸收了所有能学到的东西。当时，大型主机和小型计算机主导了行业，个人计算机和客户端-服务器系统开始崭露头角。存储系统是庞大的近线设备，首席信息官最关心的是数据中心中的一条恶意电话线。正式的CISO职位很少，安全人员通常分为两类：调查员和网络专业人员。我有些偶然地进入了安全领域，但这其实是有计划的。
- en: In 1999, I was based in Chicago and working as a healthcare specialist for Data
    General. Data General was acquired by the EMC Corporation. I explored my options
    post acquisition and decided to make a change. The change was inspired by the
    hardware token I carried for authentication. I was fascinated by the technology,
    and I pursued a company called RSA Security and was ultimately hired as a PKI
    specialist. I not only had to look up the term, I had to study and develop an
    understanding of PKI, which I did. So, in 2000, a new career began—I was still
    in tech but in a highly specialized, but very nascent, field called cybersecurity
    (InfoSec at the time). CISOs were a thing by then—in very large organizations—and
    2FA was used by about 20% of corporate employees (yes, that was all).

  zh: 1999年，我在芝加哥担任Data General的医疗保健专家。Data General被EMC公司收购。我在收购后探索了自己的选择，并决定做出改变。这一改变的灵感来自于我携带的硬件令牌用于身份验证。我对这项技术感到非常着迷，因此我开始关注一家公司——RSA
    Security，并最终被聘为PKI专家。我不仅需要查找这个术语的定义，还需要学习并理解PKI，这我做到了。于是，在2000年，一个新的职业生涯开始了——我依然在技术领域，但转向了一个高度专业化但非常初创的领域——网络安全（当时称为信息安全）。到那时，CISO职位已经存在——在一些大型组织中——而双因素认证（2FA）仅被大约20%的企业员工使用（是的，就只有这么多）。
- en: Since 2000, I have once again committed myself to self-study, learning, and
    growth—developing a deep understanding of the underlying technology of cybersecurity
    and the methods, modes, and motives of threat actors. I have also come to an understanding
    that there are simply too few people in cybersecurity roles. We used to joke,
    circa 2000, that people spent more on their annual coffee budgets than on their
    IT security budgets. If they had a firewall, a router, and an antivirus solution,
    and high-value users were using 2FA, everything was covered as far as most organizations
    were concerned. They were not prepared or adequately budgeted for the hyper growth
    in anytime, anywhere connected devices; the explosion of mobile devices that are
    as powerful as legacy servers; cloud-based technologies; the explosion of nation-state
    funded threat actors; or the explosion of malware and cybercrime as an industry.
    Universities and colleges were delayed in offering a cybersecurity-based curriculum,
    relying on a lot of network-based courses to cover the topic. Cybersecurity professionals
    were largely still from network or investigative backgrounds, and the industry
    was collapsing under the weight of too many disparate tools and too-many-point
    solutions.

    We must create a community that takes care of its members and empowers people
    to be their absolute best. We don't actually have a choice; cybercrime is here

    We can do this through investment in education programs at the grade school-level
    through to the high-school level, by investing in organizations that fund scholarships

    today, we have exactly the opposite: a tsunami of information. In the past, you
    just couldn''t really find anything; it was almost like a dark market, and now
    it is fully mainstream. I believe that today''s situation is much better from
    a self-learning perspective, as today you can easily create a lab environment
    to simulate attacks on your own machine, or in a cloud-based environment. Books
    are widely available, free online materials are usually of good quality, and there
    are far more target security certifications. So, if everything seems so good,
    why is it still so hard to start working in this field? I could give many reasons,

    is directed toward these aspects. Well-known cases such as **Carbanak**, **Mariposa**,
    and many others, where banks and their clients were directly threatened, only
    stress the need for enhanced cybersecurity in this sector. An additional problem
    is the lack of awareness of the risks posed by cyberspace. This is especially
    true for companies that are export- and import-oriented. Following investigations,

    traditional musical instrument that is just like a guitar in appearance) for almost
    20 years. My parents bought a baglama for my eldest brother in order for my uncle
    to teach him how to play it. He was not willing to play the instrument, but I
    was willing to play it. Then, I started to play it by imitating my uncle's finger
    movements. I was just following the sequence of finger-presses on the frets. I
    learned a few songs to play and expanded my repertoire. My desire to play baglama
    and daily practice made me play it better. But there was a problem. In order to
    learn a new song, I was dependent on my uncle. Because if I wanted to learn a
    new song he was playing, I had to imitate his finger movements. After that, I
    noticed musical notes. A friend of my mother, who is a music teacher, taught me
    how to read notes and apply them to the baglama. I was no longer dependent on
    my uncle. I could play new songs by reading notes. After spending more time practicing,
    I was able to write notes for songs that I heard and played by myself. Years after,
    I learned the **short-neck baglama**. The one I learned to play was a **long-neck
    baglama**. A long-neck baglama has 23 frets; on the other hand, a short neck baglama
    has 19\. The chord layout is also different. At first, I thought, *I can play
    every song with my instrument, so why would I need a different one?* But after
    listening to performers using short-neck baglamas, I recognized that it was easier
    to play a song where I needed to move my fingers very quickly. I changed my mind
    and bought a short-neck baglama. The notes' positions were different, but it still
    had the same notes. The mathematics of both instruments was the same. The only
    thing I had to do was practice. Although it is not easy to play a song for the
    first time, by applying notes and doing some practice, now I can play baglama
    professionally. Now, I am almost 35 years old, and I can also play guitar, oud,
    violin, side-flute, and some percussion instruments. But I am not a professional
    player. (For the readers who do not believe me, please visit my YouTube channel

    但是在听了使用短颈巴格拉玛演奏的表演者后，我意识到在需要快速移动手指的歌曲中，短颈巴格拉玛的演奏更容易。我改变了想法，买了一把短颈巴格拉玛。虽然音符的位置不同，但它仍然包含相同的音符。两种乐器的数学结构是一样的。我需要做的唯一事情就是练习。虽然第一次演奏一首歌并不容易，但通过应用乐谱并做一些练习，现在我已经可以专业地弹奏巴格拉玛了。现在，我快35岁了，我也能弹吉他、乌德琴、小提琴、侧笛以及一些打击乐器。但我不是专业演奏者。（对于那些不相信我的读者，请访问我的YouTube频道，别忘了订阅并点击喜欢的视频点赞按钮。）

  zh: 雇主似乎更看重那些有实际操作部分的认证。选择题形式的认证常常受到嘲笑，我发现，简历中列出没有认证的情况可能比列出这些类型的认证更好。动手操作的技能非常重要，应该通过任何可能的方法来获得。大学可以做更多的事情，将实践评估任务纳入课程，并将其推销给雇主群体。我知道有雇主更倾向于青睐能够展示实际操作技能的潜在员工的博客，而不是单纯的资格证书。他们想要看到你能展示技能，而不是描述原理（除非你想从事销售工作）。

    Reactive security does not provide a 360° view of the threat landscape but a reactive
    way of achieving security operations is always simpler, faster to bring up, and
    has lower operational costs. Reactive security monitoring can be further enhanced
    with data feeds from antivirus detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and,
    at times, DLP systems. The flip side of such a model is that it will always react
    to security detection after a breach or compromise has occurred.

  zh: 根据逻辑，反应式安全响应模型是一种*“如果发生攻击，* *系统和安全分析师将作出响应。”* 的思维方式。它是通过已知的攻击参数和方法设下陷阱，等待监控和检测系统做出反应。在反应式模式下，重点总是放在建立强大的外围防御上，以阻止试图渗透网络的攻击。这种安全形式非常依赖于业务单元及其活动，并且不会利用类似性质的攻击对另一个业务或行业领域进行防范。反应式安全无法提供威胁景观的360°视图，而实现安全操作的反应式方式总是更简单、更快速并且具有较低的运营成本。反应式安全监控可以通过来自防病毒检测系统、漏洞扫描器、甚至有时的数据丢失防护（DLP）系统的数据流进一步增强。然而，这种模型的反面是，它总是在安全检测后才对已经发生的泄露或安全事件作出反应。
- en: But proactive security monitoring and responses win over this scenario. It is
    an intelligence-driven model, where the system is enriched with actionable intelligence
    data, from multiple internal and external sources, working in line with existing
    real-time monitoring systems. This proactive method will have visibility of the
    entire threat landscape and all phases of the cyber kill chain, and not just focus
    on one or partial phases of the kill chain. One of the key aspects of proactive
    security is threat hunting, which allows analysts to get more insights into the
    network and systems by trying to uncover any anomalies, or any abnormal changes
    in network behavior, any presence of known bad files in the systems, or maybe
    there are some registry entries that can be found from previously known attacks.
    As an analyst, you can also look for known **indicators of compromise** (**IOCs**)
    in the network. Threat hunting is a continuous process and will always involve
    trying to look for a new set of information as received from threat intelligence
    sources. Threat hunting can also be done automatically by looking into network
    behavior, system anomalies, timeline analysis of certain events, looking into
    the baseline data of the network and the system for a period, and so on.

    other IT assets. This data is then collected, analyzed, and enriched to provide
    proactive and actionable threat intelligence. One of the reasons threat intelligence
    is so important is because current threats are highly sophisticated and difficult
    to detect. We must acquire very specific information and perform a search for
    signs of compromise with actionable content from any threat intel source. To stay

    IT 资产的特定威胁信息（情报）来实现。然后，这些数据会被收集、分析和丰富，以提供主动且可操作的威胁情报。威胁情报如此重要的原因之一是当前的威胁非常复杂且难以检测。我们必须获取非常具体的信息，并从任何威胁情报来源中搜索带有可操作内容的妥协迹象。为了领先于高级威胁，至关重要的是，我们需要为我们的分析和关联系统提供适当的威胁数据。
- en: Any effective and mature threat intelligence system must be able to collect
    and categorize threat information in real time to produce actionable threat intelligence
    for the SIEM and incident response systems to analyze and correlate the collected
    threat information with the security alerts and events it is monitoring. These
    threat alerts from the threat intel system will also empower SOC professionals
    to create custom signatures for further detection. Threat intelligence systems
    gather various pieces of information related to incidents, events, logs, security
    vulnerabilities, recent and past known attack data, detection data from the security
    and network devices of the organization, along with information from external
    threat feeds. You can also set up a honey pot system to collect attack information
    and use it as threat data. All data collection needs to be focused and meaningful
    for the organization that intends to use it, because every business is different,
    with distinct needs and types of infrastructure. For threat intelligence to be
    effective, the collection of intelligence data must be done in a centralized manner,
    as systems collect threats and vulnerability information from a wide range of
    locations and devices to correlate data. You must collect data from both internal
    and external sources, as both combined will provide more detailed information
    on threats and attack vectors, specific to your industry or organization. Also,
    focus on collecting information about any ongoing global attack and its attack
    vectors, related mitigation instructions and detection parameters from agencies
    such as government CERT, NIST, ENISA, and so on, along with industry sources,
    Cisco, Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, RSA, and other major vendors. You may also
    focus on open source threat intel such as OSINT, SANS Internet Storm Center, and
    Open Threat Exchange. All this collected threat information needs to be properly
    categorized and segregated based on threat types, and its importance to the business
    entity and function; it could be, for example, based on the geolocation of the
    business unit, the business applications you are using, and IT infrastructures.
    Geolocation is important from the perspective of identifying where the threat
    actually originated so that you can have more of a focus on those business locations
    of yours as a priority, as they may have been affected; this could also help establish
    whether it is a targeted attack toward your organization, or maybe a country.
    This scenario can help you pinpoint the most effected business function, application,
    or unit, and gives you room for remediation in advance, or at least on time, before
    it's too late. It will also help in defining proper mitigation and a detection
    strategy to focus on the proper utilization of resources since it is always limited,
    irrespective of the size of the organization.

- en: Most organizations in the industry today are already using SIEM as their primary
    and central monitoring platform. Traditionally, we have always used SIEM as a
    platform that receives information from the rest of the network, as we mentioned
    earlier in this chapter, to correlate and identify threats and security incidents.
    In essence, SIEM has always acted like a device that listens but doesn't say a
    word. However, with today's cybersecurity scenarios, it is prudent for SIEM to
    take a much larger part in the whole process, to say things and collaborate in
    taking action. One prominent activity that SIEM can be tasked with is integrating
    with digital forensic platforms to receive more rich and tactical information
    in real time. Digital evidence, by nature, is extremely volatile, and this also
    drives the response time for any security incident. This fragile and crucial nature
    of digital evidence in any cybersecurity incident forces us to approach the problem
    in a fully automated way. This calls for an automated way of collecting digital
    evidence from a suspected device, and we should do it right on time and integrate
    this telemetry with SIEM to trigger the collection of evidence from endpoints,
    just like a security camera starts recording the actions of a criminal with the
    help of a motion sensor. This, in turn, provides us with detailed information
    about what took place and also provides us with more accurate evidence that is
    collected at the right time—*the time when the incident took place, and not later*.
    By capturing the state of a compromised machine right after it provides shell
    access to cyber criminals, providing an initial analysis of the collected evidence,
    and making everything ready for a deep dive investigation, will help us turn the
    tables on the bad guys. Actually, this is only the beginning; we should also develop
    systems/platforms that will automatically analyze collected evidence and enrich
    this with threat intelligence to gain speed and accuracy.

    in finding security threats and risks before attackers do. The VA/PT stream is
    very exciting and is a highly hands-on field. Apart from security consulting firms
    and big corporations, currently, many product development organizations also have
    their own teams for VA/PT as part of their product security teams. VA/PT researchers
    use various scanning tools to scan the network, applications, and/or other IT
    assets, such as servers during these scanning activities and try to find as many
    vulnerabilities as possible that could be exploited by attackers. Scripting knowledge
    can be very useful here, because, as a researcher, you can then develop your own

    review of CEH, CISSP, and CISM cybersecurity jobs revealed a similar number of
    vacancies. There are around 50 more jobs with CISSP as a desirable certification;
    more than CISM and 70 more than CEH. The level playing field is slightly titled

- en: '**CEH – Certified Ethical Hacker**: A very well regarded certification, this
    is an intermediate-level credential, part of a suite from EC Council. It is well
    suited to those at the start of their move from IT into cybersecurity; expected
    experience is lower than that of CISM or CISSP. Quoting the vendor, CEH credential
    holders possess skills and knowledge on hacking practices in areas such as footprinting
    and reconnaissance, scanning networks, enumeration, system hacking, Trojans, worms
    and viruses, sniffers, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, session
    hijacking, hacking web servers, wireless networks and web applications, SQL injection,
    cryptography, penetration testing, evading IDS, firewalls, and honeypots. CEH

- en: '**CISM – Certified Information Security Manager**: This is also well regarded.
    It is an advanced level certification, part of a suite from ISACA. ISACA are focused
    on governance. CISM requires at least 5 years experience so it''s not suited to

    courses from ISC2 (pronounced *ISC squared*). To quote the vendor, CISSP credential

    and auditing? Research ISACA. Ready to be the decision maker in your business?
    Look at CISSP. All of the vendors mentioned have credible, high quality solutions
    and operate with integrity. Working with a local learning partner is a sure fire
    way to get something relevant based on your needs, current background and market
    conditions. All of these vendors have a suite of security offerings, some of which

    in his bag, and I wanted to get access to it. Of course, my brother was not that
    keen on me having access to his bag. So, to cut a long story short, after running
    a manual password attack, which, of course, took me a while since I had to write
    every single combination down, within weeks I was able to open his bag. My reward
    was his magazines; as a nine-year-old boy, having access to those kinds of magazines

    engineering with every project I completed, the security gaps that I have found
    have always frustrated me, researching every single issue that I have faced, reading
    many staff comments on the net, and doing many hands-on exercises. Then, moving
    on to IT consulting and sharing my insight with my clients from all organizations
    showed me the biggest gaps in IT departments. So, I decided to move toward information
    security and build my skills and knowledge in the field to be able to pass them
    on to everyone else around me.

    and there was a huge IT boom. I became extremely busy, running between training
    centers as a part-time tutor, teaching many Microsoft and security courses. That
    led to me opening my own training company, where I had only one room, and at the
    same time I was still working somewhere else as a full-time IT professional. Finally,
    in 2006, I quit my full-time job and started to work for myself, where I grew
    the business into a multi-branch training company. Within a few years, the business
    grew from a one-room training center to a multi-million dollar business with branches
    all across Australia.

  zh: 技术发展得如此迅速，保持与时俱进变得越来越困难，因此，如果你不喜欢阅读和学习，你的知识很快就会过时。我们正处于一个知识获取比20年前更加容易的时代；那时，为了学习，我们必须去图书馆借书（如果我们幸运的话，因为图书馆里的IT书籍并不多），但今天，博客、计算机培训、YouTube和课堂培训变得更加容易接触，也更实惠。因此，简单来说，即使你无法参加会议，今天大多数会议都可以直播，所以一定要观看；在Twitter上关注技术领袖；订阅几个有价值的邮件列表；并阅读、学习，当然，还要实践。

    Security Advisor working with Tier-1 Security issues can be unique. You might
    visit an organization that has 30,000 computers wiped out. Being able to work

    as soon as possible is indescribable for me.

    the best; mission accomplished—until the next challenge, which could be in the

- en: Being awarded a doctorate in your career after two master's and two university
    degrees might sound like the pinnacle, but it isn't. I know I am still as I was
    on the first day of my career. My biggest mission is to make cyberspace more secure
    for everyone. Having a doctorate or working in a C-level job has no direct impact
    on my mission. I will probably still take the time to write books, speak at free
    events and webinars, as well as Tier-1 conferences, in order to share my experiences,
    findings, and recommendations with as many people as I can. Knowing humans, and
    how vulnerable we are, having the mission of helping to make every person and
    every organization more aware of cyber threats is not an easy task.

  zh: 在完成两个硕士学位和两个大学学位后获得博士学位可能听起来像是顶峰，但事实并非如此。我知道我现在依然如同职业生涯的第一天。我的最大使命是为每个人的网络空间安全增添保障。拥有博士学位或在C级职位工作对我的使命没有直接影响。我可能仍然会抽出时间写书，在免费活动和网络研讨会上发言，以及参加一线会议，分享我的经验、发现和建议，尽可能多地与人们分享。了解人类以及我们脆弱的一面，有着帮助每个人和每个组织更加意识到网络威胁的使命并不是一件容易的事情。
