- en: Cybersecurity is gaining importance due to the increased number of cyberattacks
    and the huge losses that victims are reporting. In many organizations, however,
    the implementation of cybersecurity comes as a consequence of a threat or an attack.
    Organizations can decide to mount reactive, proactive, and operational cyber defenses,
    or a combination of the three depending on financial capabilities and levels of
    exposure to threats. This chapter will go through the three types of approaches
    to implementing cybersecurity and help you to choose the optimal one for your
    company.

  zh: 主动网络防御
- en: Proactive cyber defense is focused on anticipating attacks and offensively protecting
    the targets (computers, systems, and networks) whenever an attack is launched.
    The intention is to aggressively disrupt the attack or the preparation for an
    attack by the threat vector. This renders the attack vector less effective, or
    capable of being repulsed with ease. Proactive cyber defense is arguably the best
    implementation of cybersecurity even though many organizations do not give it
    much thought. This approach foresees oncoming attacks and readies an arsenal of
    defense systems and strategies to disrupt these attacks or make them ineffective.
    Company assets are therefore seldom put at risk since the threat does not come
    into contact with them. Despite these advantages, many organizations opt to remain
    reactive or use operation cybersecurity due to a number of reasons, which we will
    outline next.

  zh: 主动网络防御侧重于预见攻击，并在攻击发起时主动保护目标（计算机、系统和网络）。其目的是通过攻击向量的威胁干扰攻击或攻击准备工作，从而使攻击向量的效果减弱，甚至轻松击退攻击。主动网络防御可以说是网络安全实施的最佳方式，尽管许多组织并未给予足够关注。这种方式预见到即将到来的攻击，并准备好一系列防御系统和策略来干扰这些攻击或使其无效。因此，公司资产很少面临风险，因为威胁没有接触到它们。尽管如此，许多组织仍然选择保持反应性或采用操作性网络安全，原因有很多，接下来我们将详细说明。

    instead of anticipating cybersecurity incidences, responds to the past or present
    threats after they have happened. Therefore, only when an organization is targeted
    by hackers and breached does reactive security kick in. Using this approach, the
    victim organization assesses the threat and the impacts the cyberattack had. Using
    this information, security measures are installed to prevent similar attacks in

    requirements, threats, and many other factors continually change. Therefore, it
    becomes quite expensive to deploy proactive security measures that are mostly
    based on assumptions of the threats that could happen in the future. The reality
    is that the threats will change and so will the business. For instance, a business
    that relies on a locally hosted website to make sales might choose to to adopt
    a cloud app. Security in the cloud is offered by the vendor and thus the company
    will hardly need to focus on it. If they had a proactive security strategy, they
    might be at a loss since the expensive tools or services acquired to predict and
    protect the website will no longer be required. With a reactive security strategy,
    the business will not feel a pinch since the strategy welcomes these changes.

    of the amount to spend. The amount is determined based on the attacks that the
    organization is targeted with. The strategy is also simple for management to understand.
    There is a cause-effect relationship. The occurrence of a cybersecurity incidence

    the attack is ongoing, the response will focus on stopping the attack. For instance,
    if there is a lot of illegitimate traffic directed toward a certain server, the
    IT department might opt to take the server offline or reconfigure its IP address
    so that the attacks no longer reach it. If the attack is a breach to a system,
    the IT team might change the access credentials and kill all sessions, thus forcing
    the attackers out of the system. An attack that has already happened will elicit
    a different type of response. The IT team has to prevent repeat attacks or the
    spread of malware from the victim. Therefore, if a server was targeted, it might
    be disconnected from the network and isolated physically. If a system faced a
    brute-force attack and the login system was compromised, the login module could
    be temporarily taken out to prevent further attacks. The steps taken to respond
    to the attack can affect the impacts. However, the organization still needs to
    ensure that its clients are not adversely affected, hence the following measure
    is taken.

  zh: 被动安全策略在很大程度上依赖于组织在攻击后恢复的能力。因此，灾难恢复计划是该策略的关键组成部分。灾难恢复的优先级可能会根据组织和攻击类型的不同而有所不同。灾难恢复中有五个主要的关注点：计算机、硬件、网络、软件和数据。它们在这里进行了详细说明：
- en: Computers refer to the workstations and servers in a network. After an attack
    has happened, they need to be checked upon to determine whether they were affected.
    Enterprise antivirus systems can be used to initiate simultaneous scans to help
    with this. The hardware refers to any computing hardware in the organization,
    such as network routers, desktops, firewalls, and computer peripherals. Cybersecurity
    incidences still include physical theft or destruction of these hardware. Therefore,
    if a physical attack has happened, it is necessary to determine that all hardware
    is still in place and to replace any sensitive hardware that has been compromised
    or stolen. For instance, if a router has been stolen or destroyed, a replacement
    should be installed. Similarly, servers running sensitive systems should be replaced
    if they have been destroyed or stolen.

  zh: 计算机指的是网络中的工作站和服务器。在发生攻击后，需要对其进行检查，以确定是否受到影响。企业防病毒系统可以用于发起同时扫描，帮助完成这项工作。硬件指的是组织中任何计算硬件，例如网络路由器、桌面、消防墙和计算机外设。网络安全事件仍然包括这些硬件的物理盗窃或破坏。因此，如果发生了物理攻击，就需要确定所有硬件是否仍然完好，并更换任何已被破坏或盗窃的敏感硬件。例如，如果路由器被盗或毁坏，应安装替换设备。类似地，如果承载敏感系统的服务器被破坏或盗窃，也应进行替换。
- en: The network includes all forms of connectivity in the network. If, for instance,
    the wireless network has been breached, it is prudent for its SSID or password
    to be changed, hence forcing out the hackers. If the connection to the service
    provider has been compromised, a backup service provider should be engaged. This
    will ensure that the organization does not remain offline.

- en: Software includes both the operating systems and the applications that normally
    run in an organization. Some attackers will have tools that can attack a specific
    version of software. Therefore, when an attack occurs, the organization should
    consider updating to the latest OS versions. These versions will come with patches
    that will prevent similar attacks from recurring. In addition, some hackers might
    misconfigure some software. For instance, they might reconfigure the router to
    sabotage communication. Therefore, in such cases, the software needs to be configured
    to the correct settings. In the cases where the attacked software is infected
    with malware, the IT team can uninstall it and provide alternatives to keep the
    organization going.

- en: The data is arguably the most important digital asset, thus it should be prioritized
    in disaster-recovery. If mission-critical data has been modified or stolen, the
    IT team should reinstate the most recent backup to roll back the changes made
    or to make the data available to users that need it. Due to the vulnerability
    of data, the IT team must also ensure that, before restoration, the relevant systems
    are free from malware or a backdoor that can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized
    access to the data.

- en: The reactive security strategy is aimed at ensuring that attacks are not repeated.
    Therefore, their causes must be fully known and any factors that mediated the
    success of the attack should be identified. For instance, a system breach might
    occur simply because of the use of default passwords by system admins. The forensic
    investigations will uncover that the attack was a breach past the login controls
    and it was mediated by the use of the default credentials. The organization will
    thus have a full picture and implement better security controls to prevent the
    same attack from reoccurring. For instance, in this case, the organization might
    opt to implement two-factor authentication and create a security policy that bars
    system admins from using default passwords. By the end of the forensic investigations,
    the organization should know all the mitigation measures it must take to secure
    itself.

- en: In some cases, forensic investigations are coupled with retrieval efforts. For
    instance, if money has been stolen, the forensics might include tracing back the
    money trails to find out where it has been sent. There have been some real-life
    cases where money was stolen by cybercriminals and recovered by forensic investigators.
    Ubiquity networks is one of these organizations where $40,000,000 was stolen through
    social engineering and forensic investigations were able to trace and recover
    $8,000,000\. Besides money, forensic investigations can recover data. Most of
    the stolen data ends up on dark-web markets. Forensic investigators can scour
    the dark-web markets for new listings of certain types of data. They can then
    pose as buyers and retrieve the data from the hackers before it is sold to other
    people.

    Networks 就是其中一个例子，40,000,000美元通过社会工程学手段被盗取，而法医调查员成功追踪并追回了8,000,000美元。除了资金，法医调查还可以恢复数据。大部分被盗的数据最终会出现在暗网市场上。法医调查员可以在暗网市场上搜寻某些类型数据的新列表。然后，他们可以伪装成买家，从黑客手中将数据取回，避免数据被卖给其他人。

    adopt proactive security. Most organizations use the reactive cybersecurity strategy
    due to its simplicity and appeal to business executives. The reactive approach
    is designed to only act when a substantial threat is detected or an attack has

- en: The proactive security approach ensures that very few attacks manage to hit
    the organization. It is focused on predicting and neutralizing threats, and hardening
    attack surfaces so that it is difficult for an attacker to penetrate the organizational

    security. The reactive security approach works by responding to threats only when
    they happen. Therefore, a lot more time and resources are spent on core business
    objectives instead of cybersecurity. The reactive security approach ensures that,
    whenever an attack happens, the organization is able to recover and can identify
    the causal factors and seal them to prevent future attacks. In addition, reactive
    security involves possible tracking and recovery of stolen assets from the organization.
    The operational security approach works with people and processes. It identifies
    the risks that can be met during business operations and then creates security
    solutions to prevent any adverse effects of these risks. In addition, it ensures

    overload. In this model, you can optimize your operations by offloading some of
    the responsibilities to the SOC service vendor, for example you may choose to
    monitor the daytime shift, and let the vendor manage the night shifts, you can
    have the SIEM owned by the vendor and have your resources manage the operations,
    or you can own the SIEM and offload the operations to a vendor. In a co-managed
    way of running SOC, you have the opportunity to be more agile and maintain a high
    level of operational excellence by applying service-level agreements on the vendor
    and bring up the SOC in less time than is required in a fully owned SOC; you almost
    tap into a matured operating SOC. One of the other factors that will work in your
    favor is that you will be able to almost immediately tap into the resource skill
    pool of your vendor, should you lose your own, or in the case of vendor-managed
    analysts, you never have to worry about losing a talent, as they will maintain
    the pool. If you choose a service provider that has a well-trained and experienced
    analyst pool, this automatically benefits your security operations. On the other
    hand, if you choose to co-manage the SIEM, you can share the cost of the license,
    maintenance, and operations. This eases your business to some extent, but not
    completely, as you might still be responsible for the incident response and analysis
    with shared resources between you and the vendor, manage the governance from your

  zh: 完全管理的SOC
- en: Fully managed SOC has been the talk of the industry for a few years now. This
    model of operations provides you with the ability to outsource or offload the
    entire SOC process to a third-party vendor, with full access to its trained resources,
    SIEM and detection technologies, and proven processes. Your SOC gets a boost from
    0 to 100 in no time. Organizations will usually send all the telemetry, visibility
    data, and logs to the vendor-managed SOC data centers, from where the **managed
    security service provider** (**MSSP**) will analyze the data for security incidents/events.
    The benefit of an MSSP is higher than the other two models, because you as an
    organization will almost immediately get access to a matured SOC. An outcome-based
    result can be expected from MSSP, providing highly accurate detection and response,
    with advanced level-detection and response technologies. MSSPs have a very experienced
    and skilled pool of staff to monitor, analyze, and investigate. Scalability and
    crisis management is another benefit of a fully managed SOC, where you don't have
    to worry about whether you need to monitor more devices or applications for any
    reason, or if there is a major incident and you might need additional resources
    to help through that situation. MSSPs normally have affiliations and access to
    agencies and vendors who provide highly enriched and actionable threat data that
    is relevant to your business, which is crucial for advanced detection capabilities.
    One other benefit of having a fully managed SOC is the industry-level visibility
    and threat data sharing; if another attack is noticed with another customer of
    a similar type, that attack information and threat intelligence is almost immediately
    available to you as an advisory and within the detection infrastructure. In general,
    MSSP vendors will have access to large data centers for storage and retention
    for you to take advantage of it. The only part that you may still have to own
    is the governance of your SOC and remediation of threat in case of an attack.
    The current MSSP model is the most popular SOC model.

    和检测技术以及成熟的流程。您的 SOC 能够迅速从零提升到一百。组织通常会将所有遥测数据、可视化数据和日志发送到供应商管理的 SOC 数据中心，在那里，**托管安全服务提供商**（**MSSP**）将分析这些数据，找出安全事件/事件。与其他两种模型相比，MSSP
    的好处更大，因为作为组织，您几乎可以立即获得一个成熟的 SOC。可以预期从 MSSP 获得基于结果的结果，提供高度准确的检测和响应，采用先进的检测和响应技术。MSSP
    拥有一支经验丰富且技术娴熟的团队，负责监控、分析和调查。完全托管的 SOC 还带来了可扩展性和危机管理的好处，您无需担心是否需要因任何原因监控更多设备或应用程序，或是否发生重大事件，可能需要额外的资源来帮助应对这种情况。MSSP
    通常与提供高度丰富且可操作的威胁数据的机构和供应商建立了合作关系，这些数据与您的业务相关，对高级检测能力至关重要。拥有完全托管的 SOC 的另一个好处是行业级别的可见性和威胁数据共享；如果另一个客户出现类似类型的攻击，攻击信息和威胁情报几乎可以立即作为建议提供给您，并在检测基础设施中使用。总体而言，MSSP
    供应商将拥有访问大型数据中心的权限，您可以利用这些数据中心进行存储和保留。唯一您可能仍需拥有的部分是您的 SOC 管理和在发生攻击时的威胁修复。目前，MSSP
    模式是最受欢迎的 SOC 模式。

    the attacks in recent days were successful in bypassing the existing security
    solutions, traditional or advanced. These attacks were successful because they
    were able to hide within the legitimate realm of our network and infrastructure.
    Our current security solutions are designed to detect based on scanning for known
    issues, filtering or dropping bad things, or even trying to monitor the identity
    and user habits, but these are not able to deter the attacks. The primary reason
    is that these are still focused on reacting to the security event, responding
    to the security findings of the security events that happened, and planning for
    how to recover from them. In other words: a reactive security response. A reactive
    response is good, but it is not holding the ground to a level where it can compete
    with the advanced attacks of these days. We need to have the focus redirected
    toward a proactive security response. The industry is already moving from a reactive
    to a proactive security response. This is a paradigm shift in security framework
    and methodologies on how we predict, analyze and respond to threats. Unlike reactive
    forms of security response, proactive methodologies provide greater and more in-depth
    visibility into the attack infrastructure. In simple words, the proactive method

  zh: 网络攻击的范围和复杂性今天正在不断上升。最近的所有攻击都成功绕过了现有的安全解决方案，无论是传统的还是先进的。这些攻击之所以成功，是因为它们能够隐藏在我们网络和基础设施的合法领域中。我们当前的安全解决方案是基于扫描已知问题、过滤或丢弃坏信息，甚至尝试监控身份和用户习惯来检测的，但这些方法无法有效阻止攻击。主要原因是这些解决方案仍然侧重于响应安全事件，处理发生的安全问题，并规划如何从中恢复。换句话说：一种反应式的安全响应。反应式响应虽然有效，但并不能在足够的层面上应对如今的高级攻击。我们需要将重点转向一种主动的安全响应。行业已经从反应式安全响应转向主动安全响应。这是安全框架和方法论的范式转变，涉及我们如何预测、分析和应对威胁。与反应式安全响应不同，主动方法提供了对攻击基础设施更全面、更深入的可见性。简单来说，主动方法从攻击者的视角审视攻击面，尝试预测攻击并采取适当的措施加以防范。
- en: As the logic goes, the reactive model of security response is the mindset of,
    *"If and when there is an attack, the systems and security analysts will respond
    to it."* It's about laying a trap with known attack parameters and methods, and
    waiting for the monitoring and detection systems to react to it. In the reactive
    form, the attention is always given to forming a strong perimeter defense to thwart
    the attacks that will attempt to penetrate the network. This form of security
    is localized toward the particular business unit and its activities; it does not
    take advantage of the attacks of a similar nature against another business or
    industry verticals. Reactive security does not provide a 360-degree view of the
    threat landscape but a reactive way of achieving security operations is always
    simpler, faster to bring up and with less operational cost. The reactive way of
    security monitoring can be further enhanced with data feeds from antivirus detection
    systems, vulnerability scanners, and DLP systems. The flip side of such a model
    is that it will always react to the security detection after the breach or compromise

    model, where the system is enriched with actionable intelligence data, from multiple
    internal and external sources, working in line with the existing real-time monitoring

    and all phases of the cyber-kill chain, and not just focusing on one or partial
    phases of the kill chain. One of the key aspects of proactive security is threat
    hunting, which allows analysts to get more insight into the network and systems,
    by trying to uncover anomalies or any abnormal patterns in the network behavior,
    any known bad files in the systems, or registry entries that can be found from
    previously known attacks. As an analyst, you can also look for known **indicators
    of compromise** (**IOCs**) in the network to find any signs of compromise. Threat
    hunting is a continuous process and always tries to look for new sets of information

    for the SIEM and incident-response systems to analyze and correlate the collected
    threat information with the security alerts and events they are monitoring. These
    threat alerts from the threat-intel system will also empower the SOC professionals
    to create custom signatures for further detection. Threat intelligence systems
    gather various information related to incidents, events and logs, security vulnerabilities,

    network devices of the organization along with information from external threat
    feeds. You can also set up a honeypot system to collect attack information and

    and feed need to suit each business. Non-relevant intelligence data will lead
    to wrong assumptions, so the potential to miss the attack or compromise is greater.
    For the threat intelligence to be effective, the collection of intelligence data
    must be done in a centralized manner, as the systems collects threat and vulnerability
    information from a wide range of locations and devices to correlate data. You
    must collect data from both internal and external sources, as combined they will
    provide more detailed information on threats and attack vectors specific to your
    industry or organization. Also focus on collecting information about any ongoing
    global attack and its attack vectors, related mitigation instructions and detection
    parameters from agencies such as government CERT, NIST, and ENISA, along with
    industry sources, such as Cisco, Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, and RSA. You may
    also focus on open source threat intel, such as OSINT, SANS Internet Storm Center,
    and Open Threat Exchange. All this collected threat information needs to be properly
    categorized and segregated based on threat types, and its importance to the business
    entity and function. It can, for example, be based on the geolocation of the business
    unit, business applications you are using, and IT infrastructures. Geolocation
    is important for identifying where the threat originated from so that you can
    focus on those business locations of yours as priority as they may have been affected;
    this could also help establish whether it is a targeted attack toward your organization
    or not or maybe towards a country. This scenario can help you pinpoint the most
    affected business function, application, or unit, and gives you room for remediation
    in advance or at least on time, before it's too late. It will also help you to

    SIEM tools. It's important to learn how to use the automation orchestration, especially
    when it comes to investigating and remediating incidents. We saw CISO to a level
    1 security analyst who believed that everything can be automated, which can be
    true but they also believed that it could be done at once! Without proper documentation
    there would be less benefit of automation and orchestration. Even for the most
    ambitious expert, automating every incident and every step in your incident-response
    workflow is as realistic as trying to boil the ocean. It's much more effective
    to walk before you run, especially when you become part of an enterprise security
    team, where typically multiple cross-functional teams are involved across a variety
    of different technologies.

  zh: 步骤1——从小做起
- en: Having a smaller task or playbook will help you learn SA&O. Having a small playbook/demo
    lab with a limited set of automation tasks can often provide a great learning
    path. One example is checking an IP across multiple reputation services and computing
    a weighted reputation score. Another might be to create or update a ticketing
    system. The key concept here is to automate key parts of a larger workflow so
    that you're able to work more efficiently and avoid context switching, as well
    as the need to copy and paste across multiple interfaces.

    for many cyberattacks, learning to examine a suspected phishing email can be useful.
    Instead of repeating the same steps again and again, you can automate the repetitive
    actions, such as enriching an event with reputation data from a threat intelligence
    service, and then insert your staff into the workflow so they can make a close

    Then it's also important to define a set of metrics that can be used to measure
    the steps, which run back text help to build a report within the SOC. One common
    metric is **Mean Time to Resolution** (**MTTR**),which is a service-level metric
    for desktop support that measures the average elapsed time from when an incident
    is reported until the incident is resolved. This metric should decrease as a result
    of the efficiencies gained through security automation and orchestration.

    Using the same automatization, searching for additional instances of the same
    indicator across the organization, and then alerting analysts to any additionally
    detected occurrences would be easier. Automated or semi-automated containment

    used to query a database of vulnerabilities to gather additional information on
    the vulnerability, query Active Directory or CMDB for asset information, or query
    a SIEM or EDR for events. Based on vulnerability, host, or event information,
    the case could be automatically upgraded or reassigned, or the host could even
    be temporarily isolated until appropriate mitigation tasks could be performed.
