- en: 'To ensure that you have a smooth start to, and progress through, your career,
    there are three essential processes that you can follow. These are **mentoring**,
    **shadowing**, and **networking**. Mentoring involves a one-to-one relationship
    between you and a professional who can give you timely advice, motivation, and
    direction. Shadowing involves going to the workplace with a professional attitude
    and observing what they do. This allows you to discover more about the career
    you intend to pursue by watching what actually takes place in a normal workday.
    Lastly, networking involves building professional links with other people within,
    and outside, your line of work. Networking helps you get information, guidance,
    and support from others when it comes to developing your career, or switching
    from one career to another. This chapter will discuss the importance of these
    three essentials in your career in the following topics:'

  zh: 为了确保你在职业生涯中顺利起步并不断进步，有三个关键的流程是你可以遵循的。它们分别是**导师指导**、**跟随学习**和**建立人脉**。导师指导是一种一对一的关系，导师是经验丰富的专业人士，可以为你提供及时的建议、激励和方向。跟随学习指的是以专业的态度进入工作场所，观察导师的工作。这让你通过亲眼看到正常工作日中实际发生的情况，深入了解你打算从事的职业。最后，建立人脉是指与行业内外的其他人建立职业联系。建立人脉可以帮助你在发展职业或从一个职业转向另一个职业时，获得他人的信息、指导和支持。本章将通过以下主题讨论这三项要素在职业生涯中的重要性：

- en: 'Mentorship is important both in your education and career. There is always
    the excitement of getting things done all by yourself so that you can attribute
    all the success to yourself. Getting a job all by yourself is a significant achievement.
    Planning your career development all by yourself is also a significant achievement,
    or so it seems. However, the reality is quite different from expectations. You
    might have the best of ideas, but not actually know how to execute them. Your
    plan for growing in your career might not exactly fall into place in real life.
    Your expectations of getting a job by merely spending hours on job boards, applying
    for positions that you are qualified for, might not go as you expected. This is
    why you need a mentor to give you guidance and, also, to monitor the steps that
    you take. Mentoring is a one-to-one relationship where you seek the continued
    support and advice of a more experienced professional to guide you through any
    stage of career development. The following is a detailed list of the reasons why
    mentors are necessary to one''s career life:'

  zh: 导师指导在你的教育和职业生涯中都非常重要。独自完成一件事情总是让人兴奋，这样你可以将所有的成功归功于自己。单独找到一份工作是一个重要的成就，单独规划自己的职业发展也看似是一个重要的成就。然而，现实往往与预期有所不同。你可能拥有最好的想法，但却不知道如何付诸实践。你在职业发展的计划可能并不完全如你所愿地实现。你可能认为只要花几小时在招聘网站上申请自己符合条件的职位，就能顺利找到工作，但事实却并非如此。这就是为什么你需要导师来为你提供指导，并监督你所采取的每一步。导师指导是一种一对一的关系，你寻求更有经验的专业人士的持续支持和建议，帮助你度过职业发展的任何阶段。以下是导师在职业生活中必不可少的原因的详细列表：

- en: The best mentors, as we shall see later in the chapter, are professionals that
    have lengthy experience in their fields. They tend to have lots of knowledge that
    someone starting his or her career would benefit from. For instance, a mentor
    will be best placed to tell you the right programming languages and frameworks
    to learn. From a beginner's perspective, the best languages and frameworks are
    those fetching most money in the market. Programmers who have been working in
    the field for a long time know how hyped up languages and frameworks end up. Therefore,
    they might tell you to focus on other languages and frameworks. The same goes
    for many other professions. Besides this, you can tap into their wealth of knowledge.
    You can approach a mentor when you are faced with dilemmas or hard choices to
    make and they will help you make the best decisions.

  zh: 如本章后续所述，最好的导师通常是那些在自己领域有着丰富经验的专业人士。他们通常拥有大量的知识，刚刚开始职业生涯的人会从中受益。例如，一位导师可以告诉你该学习哪些编程语言和框架。对于初学者来说，最好的编程语言和框架是那些在市场上能赚最多钱的。但在该领域工作多年的程序员知道，市场上被炒得火热的语言和框架往往并不是最可靠的。因此，他们可能会建议你关注其他的语言和框架。其他许多职业也是如此。除此之外，你还可以利用他们的知识财富。当你面临困境或需要做出艰难选择时，可以向导师请教，他们将帮助你做出最佳决策。

    might be in your projects, your decisions, your execution, or your plans. You
    may have downplayed these faults assuming that they would not have any significant
    impact on your personal or career development. Mentors will be brutally honest
    and tell you that you need to correct areas where you have had faults. This is
    how you get to improve. Constructive criticism from mentors often helps people
    attain most of their goals as they will have eliminated the faults that were preventing
    them from being successful. Without a mentor, you rely on self-criticism which
    is, at times, deceptive, as it leads you to think that you are better or worse
    than you actually are. Mentors will give you a true reflection of yourself and
    tell you what you can do to improve.

    come with encouragement that can keep you going. Oprah Winfrey, an inspirational
    entrepreneur, defined a mentor as *"someone that allows you to see the hope inside
    yourself."* A mentor's principal concern in your engagement is to ensure that
    you achieve your goals and, when you are almost caving in, they are there to get
    you back up. Therefore, mentors will hardly let you stop, and, when you are facing
    the most challenging of obstacles, they will encourage you to keep going, and
    give guidance on how you should do that.

    the least cumbersome path to success. You will also run into many distractions.
    These distractions, taking unnecessary breaks, or looking for shortcuts, might
    delay your success. This is why mentors have a strict sense of discipline and
    create boundaries in respect of what you can or cannot do. These are what help
    create a solid work ethic, unshaken focus, and help you set your priorities in

    on their observations from the different perspectives, mentors can give their
    honest opinions regarding the viability of your ideas. Mentors can help you identify
    ideas that have potential in the long term so that you can act on them. For instance,
    if you want to learn a new framework at an inflated cost just because there are
    openings paying attractive salaries, a mentor could advise you on whether you
    should commit to learning the language. It could simply be a wave passing, and,
    after a year of learning the framework, a new one could be released rendering
    you jobless. These insights might be lacking in your decision making, and that
    is why you should consult your mentor before committing.

    you plan on making. Therefore, there is a challenge when you have to ask another
    party to give you fresh ideas or new insights into what you are working on. Mentors
    act as third parties without any stake in your ideas and will be happy to share
    with you their advice on sensitive projects. However, you should still exercise
    caution in what you divulge to others. Mentors will hardly sell out your ideas

    follow one strict path. You should also avoid mentors who have stark differences
    with you that might get in the way of the two of you working together. You should
    not try and force the mentorship relationship: follow your instincts. When you
    feel that you might end up getting into a long-term conflict with the mentor,
    it is best to cut off links with them.'

    您还应该避免与您有明显差异可能妨碍您两人合作的导师。 您不应该试图强行推动导师关系：跟随您的直觉。 当您觉得可能会与导师陷入长期冲突时，最好与他们断绝联系。

    that no one is perfect and a few flaws are acceptable. Some important qualities
    you should pay attention to when assessing a mentor are their empathy, honesty,
    timekeeping, dedication, and their listening skills. Listening skills, particularly,
    are of great importance, as much of the time that you will be interacting with
    the mentor will involve you presenting your challenges to them. If the mentor
    never lends listening ears, it is probably best to highlight this to them or cut
    off the mentorship ties with them.

    For instance, if you are poor at timekeeping, you need a mentor who is strict
    on time because this will push you to start trying to keep time. Therefore, you
    should be open to having a mentor who thinks or acts differently, provided that
    their traits will help you move out of your comfort zone. You should also be open
    to being mentored by someone outside your industry. If you are a web developer,
    a football coach could still be your mentor. Such a person has a different outlook
    on life than someone within your professional circles and will look at your challenges

- en: Networking is the building of relationships that help you get information, guidance,
    and support in your career. Networking has proven benefits of helping one advance
    more quickly in your career, get better compensation for your skills, develop
    career mobility, and get more satisfaction from your work life. Networking can
    be said to be social capital. The more people that you have in your network, the
    more social capital you have. This capital can be used to get information, opportunities,
    exposure, more networks, and long-term support in your career. With social capital,
    you can also advance and develop your career more quickly. An effective network
    must be built with certain considerations to ensure that you derive maximum social
    capital from it. The two most important considerations are network size and composition.
    Network size involves the number of contacts that you have. These contacts determine
    the opportunities that you have access to from your network. However, network
    size alone is not sufficient to give you enough social capital to grow your career
    as you could have many low-level contacts. This is why network composition is
    the most important factor in your network. Network composition is simply the type
    of people that make up your network. It is important to ensure that your network
    has contacts from different social environments, demographics and organizational
    statuses. Social environments or contexts include colleagues at your workplace,
    family members, and communities, among others. It is good to build a network with
    a mix of different social environments. This improves your chances of getting
    opportunities passed to, or shared, with them. Having contacts from different
    demographics plays a big role in opening you up for careers in distant places.
    Your current location might be saturated with people who have the same skills
    as you, but overseas there might be an acute lack of people with such skill sets.
    A diverse demographic network helps you get such opportunities, and this could
    accelerate your career development. Lastly, contacts with different organizational
    statuses are important in your network. If you only have contacts holding executive
    statuses, you can get promotions or well-paying jobs. If you have contacts with
    lower organizational statuses, you get many opportunities passed to you that you
    could apply for. There are benefits of having contacts that hold junior, middle,

  zh: 人际网络是建立关系的过程，帮助你在职业生涯中获得信息、指导和支持。人际网络已被证明有助于加速职业发展的进程，帮助你为自己的技能争取更好的薪酬，发展职业流动性，并从工作生活中获得更多满足感。人际网络可以看作是社会资本。你在网络中的联系人越多，你拥有的社会资本就越多。这些资本可以用来获取信息、机会、曝光、更多的人际网络以及职业生涯中的长期支持。拥有社会资本，你也能更快速地推进和发展职业生涯。有效的人际网络必须考虑到一些因素，以确保你能够从中获得最大化的社会资本。两个最重要的因素是网络规模和组成。网络规模涉及你拥有的联系人数量，这些联系人决定了你从网络中能够接触到的机会。然而，单纯的网络规模不足以为你提供足够的社会资本来发展职业，因为你可能拥有很多低层次的联系人。这就是为什么网络组成是你网络中最重要的因素。网络组成指的是构成你网络的人的类型。确保你的网络有来自不同社交环境、不同人口群体和不同组织职位的联系人非常重要。社交环境或背景包括工作中的同事、家庭成员和社区等。建立一个由不同社交环境混合组成的网络是一个好选择，这能提高你获得机会并与他们共享机会的几率。拥有来自不同人口群体的联系人对你开辟远方的职业机会也起着重要作用。你所在的地方可能有很多具备与你相同技能的人，但在海外，可能急需拥有这类技能的人。一个多元化的人口群体网络有助于你获得这类机会，从而加速你的职业发展。最后，拥有不同组织职位的联系人对你的人际网络也很重要。如果你只有拥有高层管理职位的联系人，你可以获得晋升或高薪工作的机会。如果你有一些低层次职位的联系人，你可以获得很多转交给你的机会并申请。拥有初级、中级和高级职位的联系人也有其好处。

    could be HR personnel, individuals working in organizations with job vacancies,
    or executives in organizations. Such contacts could help you to get jobs easily,
    with minimal struggle. There is a statistic that 80% of jobs are not advertised
    on job boards. Therefore, relying on applying for jobs from sites such as **indeed**
    is not as nearly effective as having contacts who can inform you when there are
    job vacancies. While other job seekers are competing for the 20% of the jobs posted
    on job boards, you stand a better chance of landing jobs passed to you by contacts
    that work in the organization with the vacancy. A network can also be helpful
    in getting jobs that are outside your locale. As discussed before, there could
    be places that have a shortage of a skillset; as a result, they will be willing
    to not only hire, but compensate more, someone from overseas. For instance, there
    might be a non-profit organization working in a remote place in Africa which cannot
    find a reliable local developer skilled in a certain framework. If you have a
    contact within the country, they could offer you the job with several perks. Lastly,
    contacts within your network can serve as good referrals if you get job interviews
    within organizations that they work for. This significantly increases your chances
    of getting hired.

    For instance, you could make the mistake of staying in one company that continually

    people, that there is a point at which you have to switch employers. You can also
    stay in a career with limited growth prospects, and a contact that has been in
    the same shoes could give advice on whether you should try a career change. It

    is not as simple as approaching a stranger, having a short conversation, and telling
    them that you want to add them to your professional network. This will likely
    lead to a superficial network and it will not bear any fruit. When in a scenario
    where you wish to grow your network, you must first create a genuine relationship
    with the people you are targeting. You should listen to what they say, add to
    their talk, reciprocate what they share, and find out their interests and goals.
    It is best to assume that you are creating a lifelong friendship rather than just
    aiming to using strangers to gain social capital. You could invite the person
    you are interacting with to another event, or offer to show them one of your products
    that matches their interests. If they connect with you in a way that is not superficial,
    they will most likely be more open to you and give you advice, support, resources,
    and links, in your professional relationship.
