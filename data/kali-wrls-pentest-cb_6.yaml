- en: 'In this chapter we are going to explore another form of attack: attacks against
    authentication mechanisms and the components surrounding the system. Attacking
    an authentication mechanism on a wireless network can give attackers the ability
    to access parts of the system and the resources hosted on it with very little
    or no resistance whatsoever. In fact, the very reason for having an authentication
    mechanism is to be able to validate the identity of a user or host, and if this
    is subverted or circumvented in some way, then we end up with a situation where
    all sorts of access and actions can be carried out. However, before we get into
    this chapter, let''s take a look at what authentication is, what it is designed
    to accomplish, and how it can work in a very abstract form, and then we can use
    this knowledge to understand the attacks in this chapter that much better.'

  zh: 在本章中，我们将探讨另一种形式的攻击：针对身份验证机制及其周围系统的组件的攻击。对无线网络上的身份验证机制进行攻击可以使攻击者能够非常轻松地或几乎毫无阻力地访问系统的部分和其中托管的资源。实际上，设置身份验证机制的原因是为了能够验证用户或主机的身份，如果这种验证被颠覆或绕过，那么我们最终会面临各种访问和操作。然而，在进入本章之前，让我们先看看身份验证是什么，它的设计目的是什么，以及它如何以非常抽象的形式工作，然后我们可以利用这些知识更好地理解本章中的攻击。
- en: 'So first let''s get things started by talking about what happens when you as
    a user attempt to log into a system, really any system for all purposes here.
    When a user logs into a system they are going to be subject to a number of events.
    The first thing they will do is to present an identity, which is a statement as
    to who they are claiming to be to the system they are trying to access. Now, identity
    is something that on its own is not to be used to allow access to a system, because
    all it is just a claim or assertion to someone; it''s not definitive in any way.
    This means that I can claim I am a movie star, a politician, or even the president
    of the United States, but without providing something to validate that identity,
    it''s just a claim without any merit or weight assigned to it, and therefore not
    enough to go to the later steps which grant access to trusted information resources.
    To do this, we need to move to the authentication step. The following diagram
    shows the authentication process:'

  zh: 首先让我们开始谈论当用户尝试登录系统时会发生什么，实际上任何系统都是如此。当用户登录系统时，他们将经历一系列事件。他们首先要做的是提供一个身份，这是关于他们声称自己是谁的陈述。现在，身份本身并不能用来允许访问系统，因为它只是对某人的声明或断言；它并没有任何明确的意义。这意味着我可以声称自己是电影明星、政客，甚至是美国总统，但如果没有提供一些东西来验证身份，那么这只是一个没有任何价值或权重的声明，因此不足以进入后续授予对受信任信息资源访问的步骤。为了做到这一点，我们需要转向身份验证步骤。以下图表显示了身份验证过程：

- en: 'When we say authentication, we are performing some sort of action which proves
    that the claim a user is making about who they are is actually valid. The most
    common way to do this is through the use of a password; many of us have run the
    situations where we provide a username, which would be our identity, and then
    we provide a password, which is a secret piece of information that only we know,
    that can be used to say we are who we say we are and you can trust us. So, as
    we can see, an identity in the form of a username is not enough on its own to
    prove anything; it has to be authenticated to validate that this party can be
    trusted by them providing an answer that only the person with that identity would
    know. And the system that they are authenticating to would have some way of comparing
    their provided answer—or password in this case—to something that they already
    have stored locally in order to ensure that the provided answer is correct and
    the right one. The following screenshot is an example of a Windows login box:'

- en: Factor 1 authentication covers any situation where a piece of information such
    as a pass code or passphrase or PIN number has to be provided in order to authenticate
    an identity. The important detail or element of this first factor of authentication
    is that it is something that you know and store in your brain and provide when
    requested. This is by far the most common form of authentication that is used
    in computer networks and software as well as our wireless networks, as we will
    see.

- en: Factor 2 authentication covers any sort of situation where a physical item has
    to be provided to authenticate an individual or system. Items such as a key for
    a door, an ATM card, or even a token can be used to present to the system or generate
    a special code that can be used to validate the identity of the user much like
    before. This form of authentication is also sometimes referred to as something
    you have—as in something you possess—which we can see in the case of a car door
    key. This type of authentication is not common to see in the case of wireless
    networks, but there are some exceptions, such as situations where a special code
    may be generated to log in to a corporate network or a guest network as the case
    may require.

    known as biometrics. Simply put, biometrics are a method by which we measure a
    characteristic or trait of a physical organism and use that as a way of validating
    an identity, much like you did with the first two factors. Characteristics such
    as fingerprints, eyeballs, palm prints or even facial recognition have all been
    used to provide this authentication factor. While this form of authentication
    can be very accurate and highly reliable, it does have a drawback over the other
    factors that tend to make it less common as it is more tricky to implement, considering
    the expense and complexity involved in setting up such systems. It is also worth
    noting that it is extremely rare to see this type of authentication factor with
    wireless networks as a form of authentication. This doesn''t mean you can''t use
    these authentication mechanisms with a wireless network; it just means that they''re
    not used to authenticate to the wireless network in most cases. This type of authentication

    after the system has validated who you are claiming to be. Remember, all that
    the authentication has done is validate that the identity you have provided to
    the system is not just a claim, it is actually true and correct and can be trusted
    as to its accuracy. This in no way means that you have been granted access to
    a system. Think of it as providing a driver's license or some other piece of information
    to an official. Just because that documentation checks out and says you are who
    you are claiming to be it does not mean that you will be allowed to, for example,
    enter restricted areas or carry out some other actions, because all it does is
    prove that you are who you are claiming to be, and that's it. For you to be able

- en: So, what is authorization? Well authorization is actually quite simple. Authorization
    takes your validated identity and compares it against a set of rules that are
    configured on the system. These rules are used to determine what your specific

    be very tough to ensure that these credentials are accurate when they are transmitted

    wishing to cause you harm by stealing your data or modifying data on your network
    during transmission. A few years ago the attacks that were successful against
    this protocol were a lot tougher to carry out successfully than they are now simply
    because the tools required a higher degree of knowledge and experience to operate.

- en: Let's fill a little more back story on the WEP protocol, just to fully flesh
    out the angle we're approaching things from. This protocol was designed way back
    in 1997 as part of the original wireless standards. It was designed to use a reasonably
    strong encryption protocol known as RC4, designed to protect traffic against accidental
    disclosure, and it used CRC 32 for integrity protection. Neither of these protective
    measures were a bad decision. However, they were used improperly in the design
    and implementation of WEP.

  zh: 让我们在WEP协议上填补一些更多的背景故事，以充分阐明我们所探讨事物的角度。这个协议早在1997年设计，作为最初的无线标准的一部分。它旨在使用一个相当强大的加密协议，称为RC4，旨在保护流量免受意外泄露，并使用CRC
    32进行完整性保护。这些保护措施都不是一个坏决定。然而，在WEP的设计和实施中却被错误地使用了。
- en: To understand one of the problems with WEP, we need to understand how keys are
    generated in this protocol. In practice the standard 64-bit WEP protocol makes
    use of a 40-bit key plus a 24-bit initialization vector or IV which together forms
    what is known as the RC4 key. This key is what was used to encrypt and protect
    traffic during transmission.

  zh: 要理解WEP的问题之一，我们需要了解在这个协议中如何生成密钥。实际上，标准的64位WEP协议使用了一个40位密钥加上一个24位的初始化向量或IV，它们一起形成了所谓的RC4密钥。这个密钥是用来在传输过程中加密和保护流量的。
- en: The astute reader will quickly look at the fact that we are using a 40-bit key
    plus a 24-bit initialization vector as a problem - specifically, the 40-bit key
    is a big problem to concern ourselves with. At the time this 40-bit number was
    decided upon, technology was already available that made cracking the short version
    of the key more than possible in a reasonable amount of time. Nowadays, cracking
    a key of this sort is extremely easy and takes little to no time at all. So inevitably
    the question comes up as to why the developers of this protocol decide to use
    such a short key when longer encryption keys are stronger and better in most cases.
    The biggest reason is that at the time that WEP was designed, the United States
    government had strict export controls on cryptographic technologies and any technology
    or device that implemented or made use of such cryptographic tools. It was due
    to these restrictions that the key size was limited to such a degree. Later on
    after such restrictions were lifted the key links were increased to 104-bits with
    a 24-bit initialization vector. There are some longer links available, but even
    with this 128-bit key size the protocol still has vulnerabilities and thus should
    not be used.

    or was translated into a hexadecimal value, meaning that it used a key that incorporated
    values from `0` to `9` and `A` through `F`. Consumers or systems administrators
    using WEP on their access point would be entering their key directly on the access
    point and then enter the same key on all the clients they wish to connect and
    everything would work accordingly.

    leads to some definite problems that make our chance of attack and its success
    quite high. You should examine why this is possible so we can understand why the
    attack that we're using works as well as it does. First let's understand that
    the RC4 is a symmetric and stream cipher that quickly loses its effectiveness
    if the same key is used twice during the same transmission of data. If the key
    is used twice it opens up a door that allows us to compare traffic and look for
    patterns that may reveal the key. The way the designers decided to defeat this
    type of situation was to use a 24-bit initialization vector which when combined
    with the 40-bit key was intended to prevent keys being reused during the same
    transmission. However the short 24-bit length of the initialization vector means
    that on a sufficiently busy network the chances of the same key being reused over
    and over increases dramatically. In fact just to throw out some numbers, the chance
    of the same key being reused increases to about 50 percent after around 5000 packets
    have been transmitted. Therefore it's not hard to imagine that on a sufficiently
    busy network you could gather this amount of packets pretty quickly. In fact,
    our attack relies on the fact that we are able to capture several thousand or
    hundred thousand plus packets and use them to successfully recover the key.

  zh: 这个协议的构造方式以及提供的密钥链接导致了一些明显的问题，使我们的攻击机会和成功率相当高。您应该研究为什么这是可能的，这样我们就能理解我们使用的攻击为什么如此有效。首先，让我们了解RC4是一种对称和流密码，如果在相同的数据传输过程中使用相同的密钥两次，它会迅速失去效力。如果密钥被重复使用，就会打开一个门，允许我们比较流量并寻找可能揭示密钥的模式。设计者决定打败这种情况的方式是使用一个24位的初始化向量，当与40位密钥结合使用时，旨在防止在相同的传输过程中重复使用密钥。然而，初始化向量的短24位长度意味着在足够繁忙的网络上，相同的密钥被重复使用的机会会大大增加。事实上，仅仅举个例子，大约传输5000个数据包后，相同密钥被重复使用的机会就会增加到约50%。因此，可以想象在足够繁忙的网络上，您可以很快地收集到这么多数据包。事实上，我们的攻击依赖于我们能够捕获数千甚至数十万个数据包，并使用它们成功地恢复密钥。
- en: Just to give you some numbers on how easy it is to successfully and quickly
    break this protocol, think of some of the cases that are on record. In 2005 it
    was shown that a WEP key could be recovered from a wireless network using the
    protocol in around just three minutes, or even less depending on the environment.
    Later attacks that showed up over the following years have further reduced this
    time and some have even claimed that they are able to recover the key from traffic
    using as few as 40,000 packets with a better than 50 percent probability of success
    each and every time. This should really bring into focus why this is just not
    a good protocol to be using, and those who are still using it should be strongly

    a network does not generate a lot of these items in a short period of time. Under

    by utilizing the information from our previous recipe, together with some new
    skills, to retrieve the key. To put it simply, we will inject packets into the

- en: Now let's move on to the moment of truth, where we will be generating or inducing
    our target network to generate traffic that we can use to recover the key. The
    way this process works is by using something known as an ARP request or broadcast.
    What we're trying to do is send out an ARP request just like any normal network
    client would. However, when this broadcast goes out looking for a client, the
    access point will, by design, rebroadcast this out to the network every time we
    send one out. So it has the effect of generating a lot of traffic that is in turn
    encrypted and protected with the WEP key. And since we are going to be listening
    and capturing this traffic to a file, if things go right we will have recorded
    a bunch of traffic that used the key (if we're patient), and that we can run a
    cracking operation or recovery operation on.

    As seen in our previous recipe WEP has a lot of drawbacks and vulnerabilities
    that could be exploited quite simply to gain access to and expose the information
    on networks protected with this protocol. Due to vulnerabilities and issues with
    WEP a replacement was sought, and an immediate replacement came in the form of
    WPA. WPA was designed to be an update or upgrade to WEP that can be implemented
    strictly to firmware upgrades on wireless network cards as well as wireless access
    points that were able to support the newer standard. When this new technology
    was introduced it solved a lot of the problems that WEP had brought to the table

- en: It is important to note that while most wireless cards were able to have a simple
    firmware update performed to include the new features and capabilities available
    with WPA, not every wireless card could be upgraded through firmware to support
    the new technology. In some cases wireless network cards had to be outright replaced
    in order to take advantage of the newer technology as it debuted. On the other
    side of the equation, access points that were used to anchor a wireless network
    required much more extensive upgrades and work to be done than could be allowed
    on a standard firmware update in most cases. As a result most of the access points
    available before 2003 were unable to be upgraded to support WPA, which meant that
    users had to replace these access points rather than upgrade them. In most cases
    it was because the older hardware did not have the processing power available
    to support the beefier requirements that were seen in the newer standard.

- en: 'WPA is built on a standard known as IEEE 802.11i. The standard defined a number
    of things, not all of which would be implemented immediately with WPA; some would
    have to wait for the newer WPA2 standard protocol to be implemented. However from
    this standard we did see the implementation of what is known as the Temporal Key
    Integrity Protocol, or TKIP. This technology was designed to replace what WEP
    used with its 64 or 128-bit keys. With this new protocol, keys were generated
    dynamically on a per packet basis with a new 128-bit key for each packet, meaning
    that the attacks that we saw with WEP are no longer possible with WPA. The following

    WEP. WPA uses what's called a message integrity check, which is designed to perform
    the same purpose as prior technologies, meaning that it is designed to stop an
    attacker from altering or re-sending data packets in what is known as a data replay
    attack. The reason for this replacement of the old CRC protocol is that the older
    protocol wasn't really sufficient to protect against all sorts of data integrity
    checks and replay attacks. Thus, it was decided that the newer message integrity
    checking—that actually had been in use in many forms for a while—should be implemented
    in WPA. It is actually worth mentioning that one of the reasons why some older
    network cards and access points cannot be updated to the newer WPA protocol is
    that the message integrity check is actually more computationally intensive than
    the old CRC check used in WEP.

  zh: WPA还更新和简化了WEP中存在的完整性检查。WPA使用所谓的消息完整性检查，旨在执行与先前技术相同的目的，这意味着它旨在阻止攻击者更改或重新发送数据包，即所谓的数据重放攻击。替换旧CRC协议的原因是，旧协议实际上并不足以保护所有类型的数据完整性检查和重放攻击。因此，决定应该在WPA中实施新的消息完整性检查，这实际上在许多形式上已经使用了一段时间。值得一提的是，一些旧的网络卡和接入点无法升级到新的WPA协议的原因之一是，消息完整性检查实际上比WEP中使用的旧CRC检查更需要计算能力。
- en: Note that since the newer WPA protocol with the message integrity check in place
    was implemented, it has been found that there are some flaws in the protocol relating
    to this technology. It is also important to note that the encryption technology
    used overall in WPA has been found to have flaws as well. However, it is also
    important to note that while there are flaws in WPA they are not as dramatic and
    glaring as those that are present in WEP. Nevertheless, at the end of the day,
    if one has an option to upgrade to WPA2 they should take that option, rather than
    staying with WPA or even WEP.

    on two different devices from two different vendors. However, it is important

- en: To set up a discussion on WPS let's first envision a scenario where we would
    want to use WPS. Imagine a network that is using WPA or WPA2 in a personal configuration,
    not an enterprise configuration. In this situation we would have a key entered
    into the access point that we in turn share with any of the clients that wish
    to connect to that access point so they can authenticate and encrypt their traffic.
    As we discussed in the previous recipes, if you want to use this setup or you
    have it in place in your environment it simply means that the key that you entered
    on the access point will now have to go to each client manually, at which point

- en: Something to remember with WPS is that it does not work with deprecated technologies
    and only works with WPA or its successor. Specifically, this means that WPS will
    not work with WEP in any way, shape, or form and thus if your router does not
    support anything newer then WEP it will not have this feature. It is also possible
    that if your router does support WPA or its successor that it may not support
    WPS either if it came out around the time frame that WPS was just being introduced.
    It is possible that some of these routers may still be in existence or be present
    in your environment.

    go to the access point and enter in the key within the guidelines or rules required
    by the protocol that they have selected. Then they would go to each device and
    open up their wireless client and select the wireless network that they wish to
    attach to; in this case, the one that they configured with the key. Once they
    picked the network by clicking on it there would be a request sent out by the
    client to connect to the wireless network, and in turn the wireless network would
    issue a challenge and the user would be prompted for the key, which they would
    then put in. The problems for those that are not technically savvy or a little
    bit uncomfortable to process are many. One of the biggest issues is that they
    can put the wrong key in and have to go through the process again and undoubtedly,

    page of the manual or on the router itself, and should be noted. In some cases,
    devices that are WPS button that still have WPS support will ask for the PIN,

    it requires logging in to the router and doing some configuration on that before
    any of the processes working in the device will be authenticated. It's also worth

    another way of synchronizing or sharing the WPS pin codes with clients from the

    client wishing to connect to the wireless network will take their tablet or smart
    phone and waved over a spot on the router which will in turn read the code into
    the device and allow it to sync with the network. The method in use is similar

    only have WPS support enabled but it is incredibly difficult if not impossible

    on the router in order to just be able to disable WPS itself. For example, on
    some wireless access points you may have to disable the main wireless network
    and instead go with the guest network as your primary network. In other wireless
    networks the access point will allow for WPS to be enabled if you do things such
    as shutting off the broadcast of the SSID of the network. However in this latter
    case this may not be something that you want to do. Always look to your access

    is stored presents some problems. Without getting into all the particulars, essentially
    this eight-digit PIN is broken into two four-digit blocks that are exchanged between
    the client and the access point. Due to the way this code is checked between the
    client and the access point there is not a strong system for validating this code.
    Due to the way this code is broken into two blocks and how this process behaves
    afterwards it becomes easy for an attacker to use software to guess the correct
    PIN code. In fact just to make things easy and to step away for the mathematics
    of the whole process, because of the way the PIN code is validated we find that
    it is possible for someone to get the correct code by only making 5,500 guesses,
    which is easy for modern computers to do. In Kali, we find that we have software

    that a PIN code only allows the numbers zero through nine to be used in every
    one of the eight slots in the PIN code you could do the math and come up with

- en: First of all, we don't even have eight digits for the PIN code, as the last
    digit is used as a checksum or way to verify that the code has been transmitted
    correctly and there are no flaws. So that leaves us with seven digits. However,
    the problem here is that though seven digits are not evaluated as one contiguous
    number; it is in fact broken into two pieces. The Wi-Fi enabled device will send
    the router for the first four digits, which will get validated, and then it will
    send the last three separately for validation. If we do the math at this level
    we find that with four digits we have 10,000 different combinations and with three
    digits we have 1,000 different combinations; if we add these two together we have
    11,000 possible combinations of codes. If we do the math little bit more and use
    a little logic, we find that more likely an attacker probably would have to guess
    about half the codes before they get something that successfully solves the problem.
    This is where we get the aforementioned 5,500 guesses. However, if we wanted to
    it and do an exhaustive brute force search of all the possible codes, this would

- en: Once you've found a network you wish to run the attack against, operating `reaver`
    is very straightforward. The basic command needs only the local interface, channel,
    and ESSID to be specified.

    `-vv`; this enables verbose output which greatly helps when trying to gauge how
    well `reaver` is functioning.

- en: This output shows that WPS pins are successfully being tried against the target
    (here we see `12345670` and `00005678` are being tested), and `reaver` is operating
    normally.
  id: totrans-199

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这个输出显示WPS PIN已成功地针对目标进行了尝试（这里我们看到“12345670”和“00005678”正在被测试），并且“reaver”正常运行。
- en: This process may take a lengthy period of time, but you will see feedback telling
    you that the attack is in progress and functioning. What may slow down the attack
    is the fact that many vendors have been trying to implement protections against
    WPS attacks, and additional options may be required to get the attack moving.

  zh: 这个过程可能需要很长的时间，但您会看到反馈告诉您攻击正在进行并且正常运行。可能会减慢攻击的是许多供应商一直在尝试实施防御WPS攻击的保护措施，可能需要额外的选项来推动攻击。
- en: Luckily, `reaver` keeps a progress log file automatically, so you can stop the
    attack at any time and resume whenever it's convenient. Spending a few hours a
    day running `reaver` against the same network should uncover its PIN, and through
    that the WPA passphrase.

  zh: 幸运的是，“reaver”会自动保留一个进度日志文件，因此您可以随时停止攻击并在方便的时候恢复。每天花几个小时运行“reaver”对同一个网络进行攻击，应该能够找到它的PIN码，从而找到WPA密码。
