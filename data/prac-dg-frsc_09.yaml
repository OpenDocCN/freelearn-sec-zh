    matter, consider the location of an incriminating e-mail found in the **Sent Mail**

    examination (all too common), since there is a typically implied presumption of
    guilt because the computer owner is the one most likely responsible for its creation
    and dispatch. In an evidence-led examination, the evidence is examined objectively
    without bias and faulty intuition, and an attempt is made to determine its antecedents
    and links to possible transgressors. Knowing the full processes involved in this
    alternative type of examination, the courts would prefer such an objective process

- en: In this example, the simple statement that the e-mail file was in the outbox
    suggests that it was sent by some user of the computer—well, it was or it wasn't.
    But in reality, checking its antecedents raises a range of questions, including
    determining whether there was a "hack", whether it was sent from another computer
    and synchronized to the suspect's computer, whether the timestamps were anomalous,
    or whether the message has been manipulated. If the response to each of these
    questions is a yes or no or even uncertain, it is possible, with careful attention
    to detail, to make some sense of what happened, but that still requires a measure
    of likelihood because of the result. If the answers to some or all questions are
    uncertain, that increases doubt as to the reasonableness of the evidence; consequently,
    some testing, checking, and, if possible, corroboration of the evidence, is necessary

    based on personal feelings. Unsuccessful prosecutions based on what has been exposed
    as biased and faulty interpretation of digital evidence are not that uncommon.
    This is unhelpful, as it can aggravate cases where the evidence, if successfully

    the probability of such an event having taken place was infrequent, highly improbable,

    of 1 in 100 that the application was running at the time of the transgression
    will be observed even if a remote application compromise does not occur. In the
    test sample, the prior probabilities were set at 0.1 and 0.01 to see whether there
    were any significant differences in calculating the output to these two questions.

- en: These post probability ratios were calculated on the perception that if the
    answer to either question was in the positive, then the likelihood of a remote
