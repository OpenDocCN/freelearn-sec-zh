    security knowledge is being utilized by a corporation, government, small business,
    firm, non-profit, extracurricular group, or some other structure, they all fit

- en: Let's look at a few other basic terms. How about **information**? Information
    includes data but can also include common knowledge or intellectual property.
    For example, the new company slogan that is written down on a whiteboard after
    a brainstorming session is now "information," which should be protected, even
    if it isn't "data" in terms of it sitting on a hard drive in ones and zeros.

  zh: 让我们看看其他一些基本术语。比如**信息**如何定义？信息包括数据，但也可以包括常识或知识产权。例如，经过头脑风暴会议后写在白板上的新公司口号，现在被视为“信息”，即使它不是“数据”（即以二进制形式存储在硬盘上），它也应该受到保护。
- en: 'That logically brings me to **security**, or *the state of protection*. Information
    has the ability to be secured in various ways, most commonly noted as a triangle
    or "triad" of concepts called the **CIA Triad**. You''ll remember this from other
    InfoSec books and training you have done, but **CIA** stands for **confidentiality**,

  zh: 这逻辑上引出了**安全**，即*保护状态*。信息可以通过多种方式进行保护，最常见的是一个三角形或“三元组”的概念，称为**CIA三元组**。你可能从其他信息安全书籍和培训中见过它，但**CIA**代表**机密性**、**完整性**和**可用性**。它们在信息安全的日常操作中非常重要，这就是为什么它们再次被提到：

    means that those with permission to access the information can access it in a
    timely fashion. The reason the *CIA Triad* is often represented as a triangle

- en: The often-forgotten "N" in the CIA Triad is **non-repudiation**, which is a

    combined with the *impact* of that *threat* exploiting that *vulnerability*, you
    can measure the level of *risk* associated with that **security event**. Your
    organization faces many risks on a daily basis, and those risks may or may not
    already have **risk scores** and annualized costs associated with them, as determined

    isn't about removing all the risk an organization faces, or adding bureaucracy
    for bureaucracy's sake. Risk management provides transparency and accountability

    you cannot have a *risk* without an **asset**. Your organization has many *assets*:

    a high level of success for creating an information security strategy. We'll discuss
    creating information security policies, procedures, and playbooks, as well as
    establishing and maintaining a security awareness program, managing third-party

    an era of growing cyberattacks and increased reliance on digitalization. With

- en: First of all, you'll be happiest when you have legally binding **Service-Level
    Agreements** (**SLAs**). SLAs are a promise from a third party that they will
    keep their service to a certain standard of availability, confidentiality, and
    integrity, among other things. As an example, often, a cloud IaaS SLA might deem
    that in the event of an outage that causes availability to drop below 99.9% (or
    99.99%, or 99.999%) for the month or year, the third-party will reduce the costs
    to their client. This is sometimes referred to as "three nines," "four nines,"
    and so on. It's a way for your organization to mitigate availability risk by offsetting
    the monetary loss experienced from that loss of availability. In a way, your SLA
    is a legally binding control that you are able to report on and ensure is effective.
    SLAs are negotiable in the sales process and can sometimes go back and forth between
    the client and supplier multiple times, with redlining and pushing back from either
    side before an agreement is made. If you work at a CSP, you might find yourself
    as the information security professional who's responsible for negotiating the
    SLAs on the other side as well.

  zh: 首先，当你拥有具有法律约束力的**服务水平协议**（**SLAs**）时，你会感到最安心。SLAs是第三方的承诺，他们将维持一定标准的服务，确保可用性、机密性和完整性等方面的要求。例如，云IaaS的SLA通常规定，如果因故障导致可用性低于99.9%（或99.99%、99.999%）的月度或年度标准，第三方将降低客户的费用。这种情况有时被称为“三个9”、“四个9”等等。它是一种帮助贵组织降低可用性风险的方式，通过抵消因可用性损失带来的财务损失。在某种程度上，你的SLA是一项具有法律约束力的控制措施，你可以据此报告并确保其有效性。SLA在销售过程中是可以协商的，有时可能在客户和供应商之间来回谈判，双方可能进行多次修订和反复推敲，直到达成一致。如果你在CSP工作，你可能会发现自己是负责谈判SLA的那位信息安全专业人士。
- en: In addition to SLAs, you could use what is known as a **Vendor Security Assessment
    Questionnaire** (**VSAQ**), which is able to be completed by any current vendors
    or prospective vendors. What these VSAQs do is ask a standard set of questions
    for due diligence purposes and record-keeping. The response to these questionnaires
    should be considered during the procurement phase, with risk as the backbone of
    that analysis. Generally, a VSAQ will go over the security program of the vendor,
    any controls they have put into place for protecting their estate, the training
    and awareness that the employees undertake, and the types of audits (along with
    the audit results) that the vendor regularly undergoes. VSAQs are a way to get
    an account on record from the person in charge of information security at the
    company you're paying to process or store your organization's confidential data,
    business processes, and PII or PHI.

    at a CSP and are responsible for answering these VSAQs yourself, then you would
    be very right in cataloguing your responses to those questionnaires, along with
    creating a VSAQ FAQ. It will save you countless painful hours of repetitive work.
    In previous roles at SaaS vendors, I've had a privacy and security whitepaper
    prepared, which answered every question asked in the VSAQs, with drawings and
    technical details provided, which I would then initially pass to each prospective
    customer for them to look through and fill their own questionnaires out. It was
    very helpful in the months leading up to GDPR's effective "start date," where

    to either complete their answers via the app or load their answers from a file,
    and then submit their responses to standard VSAQ questions. Unfortunately, I haven't
    seen nearly enough vendors or customers using this format. It would save so much
    time to just standardize and create the "gold standard" VSAQ and let us all get
    on with making our organizations more secure. Another type of questionnaire is
