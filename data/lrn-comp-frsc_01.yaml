- en: Your phone calls, bank access, and medical appointments are tracked via digital
    technology. If it tracks your mundane daily activity, what about criminal or unethical
    behavior? Of course, that activity is also followed, and if you are a digital
    forensic investigator, you must know the repositories of the digital evidence
    and how to analyze it. All activity, benign or criminal, will most likely generate
    some sort of digital evidence. As an investigator, it is your job to locate all
    data of interest, process it, and present the evidence to the finder of fact.
    This chapter will introduce you to the different topics of computer-based investigations,
    from criminal acts investigated by the police to civil and potentially illegal
    actions performed by an employee, and an external third party examined by a nongovernmental
    investigator.

    What is digital forensics? It is a division of forensics involving the recovery
    and analysis of data that has been recovered from digital devices. At one time,
    the term *digital forensics* was treated as a synonym for computer forensics,
    but now it involves all devices capable of storing digital data. No matter what
    term is used, the goal is to identify, collect, and examine/analyze digital data
    while preserving its integrity. Digital forensics is not only about finding the
    artifact; it is a formal examination/analysis of the digital evidence to prove
    or disprove whether the accused committed the violation.

  zh: 本书旨在向初学者介绍数字法医学领域。什么是数字法医学？它是法医学的一个分支，涉及从数字设备中恢复和分析数据。曾几何时，“数字法医学”一词被视为计算机法医学的同义词，但如今它涵盖了所有能够存储数字数据的设备。无论使用什么术语，目标都是识别、收集并检查/分析数字数据，同时保持其完整性。数字法医学不仅仅是寻找证据，它是对数字证据的正式检查/分析，旨在证明或反驳被告是否犯有该罪行。
- en: It is not always about demonstrating that the suspect is guilty; as a forensic
    examiner, you also have that ethical obligation to find **exculpatory** evidence
    that will prove the subject’s innocence. In addition, you must be an unbiased
    third party in presenting the investigation’s findings. In a criminal examination,
    your findings could deprive someone of their liberty, and in a corporate investigation,
    your findings may lead to a criminal investigation or cost someone their livelihood.
    As a digital forensic examiner, your conclusions can have an extraordinary impact
    on the subjects of the investigation.

- en: To be a digital forensic examiner, you need to have a desire to ask questions,
    have specialized equipment, and have the required training. From teaching people
    interested in the field, I have found the best students can critically examine
    the facts and circumstances being presented and, using that ability, can focus
    their efforts on efficiently reaching an accurate conclusion. Unfortunately, I
    find many students want to use a “find evidence” button, find all the artifacts,
    and print up a thousand-page report and call it a day. That is not digital forensics.

- en: Digital forensics is not finding the artifact. By artifact, I am talking about
    an incriminating Google search in browser history, an incriminating email between
    the subject and a co-conspirator, and illicit images found in the filesystem.
    Artifacts are breadcrumbs leading to the identity of the person conducting the
    illegal activity. However, on their own, they do not identify the user who created
    these artifacts or the one who is responsible for their creation indirectly. One
    of the biggest challenges in this field is identifying the user who is physically
    operating the device. You want to tie the user to the specific subject, and to
    do that, you have to analyze – that is the keyword – the digital evidence to associate
    it with a particular user.

    there are some crimes where someone will have used their computer as a tool to
    commit the crime, such as sending harassing emails, fraud and forgery, hacking,
    corporate espionage, or the trafficking of illicit images. Your occupation will
    dictate your response to a situation; if you are law enforcement, you will have
    one set of procedures to follow, while if you are in the corporate world, you

    via our mobile devices, tablets, laptops, and computers–we are always connected
    in one manner or another. Depending on who you ask, it is either the best thing
    in the world or the worst. There are some excellent aspects; social media allows
    people/family members to stay in contact, no matter where they are in the world.
    The totality of the world’s knowledge is just a few clicks away. You can read
    news reports from portions of the world that you previously did not know existed.
    It is an adventure waiting to happen. Now, it is not all unicorns and rainbows
    out there. Like any society, there are dark and dangerous portions of the internet
    where you should be hesitant to travel. That includes the sourcing and sharing
    of illicit images. For our purposes, an illicit image is an image whose subject
    matter is offensive or illegal, depending on your cultural or legal landscape.

    images was almost eradicated, so what changed? The consumer of illicit images
    no longer had to be physically present to pick up the physical images. The internet

    the software reaches out to the other users who possess the desired file. Each
    user then provides a piece of the file to the recipient. When all the pieces are
    collected, the software returns them to the original configuration. The user could

    room, and the investigator did not recognize the suspect was wearing a smartwatch.
    While they left the subject unattended in the interrogation room, the subject
    was able to communicate with their co-conspirators and direct their efforts to
    destroy evidence and interfere with the investigation. Once the investigators
    caught on to the subject’s actions, they used the smartwatch to show the criminal
    conspiracy. They used the evidence to generate additional charges for the suspect

    statements. A review of the documents showed the previous employer did not suspect
    intellectual property theft before they filed the case.

  zh: 该公司受聘协助一位世界著名科学家的法律团队，这位科学家被指控从前雇主那里窃取知识产权，并且此案件已提交到联邦法院。这起案件涉及大量与计算机取证相关的发现过程。人们担心前雇主滥用法律程序，阻止客户与另一家雇主合作。前雇主与客户之间没有签署不竞争协议。前雇主希望获得禁令，因为他们认为客户窃取了知识产权。客户的律师事务所提供了所有法院文件和发现材料的副本，包括证词记录和专家陈述。对这些文件的审查表明，在提起诉讼之前，前雇主并未怀疑知识产权被盗。
- en: The previous employer did not conduct a forensic analysis on the workstations
    used by the client before they filed in federal court. The statements of the forensic
    expert contained inaccurate information, such as the client removed emails from
    the employer because the modified date time stamps of the OST file showed the
    file had been modified the day before the client left the organization.

  zh: 在联邦法院提起诉讼之前，前雇主没有对客户使用的工作站进行取证分析。取证专家的陈述中包含了不准确的信息，例如客户从雇主处删除了电子邮件，因为 OST 文件的修改日期时间戳显示该文件是在客户离开公司前一天被修改的。

- en: The expert statement related that this was proof that the client had extracted
    emails that belonged to the organization. The expert could not think of a valid
    reason a user would create an OST file other than for illegal purposes. Outlook
    creates OST files when the client connects to the Exchange server. This is an
    automated process and not user-initiated. The modified timestamp indicates when
    the contents of the OST file have been changed, such as receiving and sending
    emails. An interview with the client was conducted to understand the network configuration
    of the previous employer. Consultations with the client’s legal team helped develop
    a plan to address the expert statements, which were prolonging the matter and
    draining the client’s financial resources.

  zh: 相关专家声明称，这证明了客户提取了属于该组织的电子邮件。专家无法想到除非法目的外，用户创建 OST 文件的有效理由。Outlook 在客户端连接到 Exchange
    服务器时会创建 OST 文件。这是一个自动化过程，而非由用户启动。修改的时间戳指示了 OST 文件内容发生变化的时间，例如接收和发送电子邮件。为了了解前雇主的网络配置，进行了与客户的访谈。与客户的法律团队进行的咨询帮助制定了应对专家陈述的计划，这些陈述延长了问题的处理时间并消耗了客户的财务资源。
- en: The client’s legal team requested the digital evidence for examination by the
    forensic team. The forensic team performed their analysis in preparation to depose
    the opposing forensic expert. It was also noted that the previous employer’s legal
    team filed the expert’s statements, which lacked a digital or physical signature
    of the expert. When the forensic images of the workstations used by the client
    were examined and compared to the “facts” presented in the six statements of the
    expert, they found the findings to be inaccurate. The next step was to interview
    the defense expert, which was much harder than it should have been. Ultimately,
    the federal judge, hearing the matter, ordered the previous employer to produce
    the expert and to make them available to the client’s legal team.

  zh: 客户的法律团队请求将数字证据交给取证团队进行检查。取证团队进行了分析，为了准备质询对方的取证专家。还注意到，前雇主的法律团队提交了专家的声明，这些声明缺乏专家的数字或物理签名。当对客户使用的工作站的取证镜像进行检查并与专家六份声明中呈现的“事实”进行对比时，他们发现这些发现并不准确。下一步是面谈辩方专家，但这比预想的要困难得多。最终，审理此案的联邦法官命令前雇主出示专家，并确保专家可供客户的法律团队使用。
- en: Their expert stated he did not make the conclusions found in the reports, nor
    were they the reports he created. The expert reports filed by the previous employer’s
