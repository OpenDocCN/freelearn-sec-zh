    a vital role. This is further coupled with the proliferation of cloud-based and
    mobile technologies. <q>"Why focus on security?"</q> is a question that has moved
    from mere security team discussions to board room discussions, and it doesn't
    stop there either. This, now, is the talk of the industry today. Everyone we know
    around us, in our work places or otherwise, is talking about security, one way
    or the other. Security is no longer just a requirement of an IT administrator,
    or security administrators in an IT organization. It is now the requirement of
    all those entities who are connected in one way or the other with any type of
    data.

    However, in reality, hacking was in practice even before that. it goes as far
    back as 1834, yes almost two centuries back. Historically, it came to light in
    the year 1836 when two persons involved in the act were caught. During the last
    decade of 1700, France implemented its national data network to transfer data
    between Paris and Bordeaux, which was one of its kind at the time. It was built
    on top of a mechanical telegraph system, which was a network of physical towers.
    Each tower was equipped with a unique system of movable arms on the tower top.

  zh: 关于黑客攻击的普遍看法是，它始于几十年前。然而，实际上，黑客行为早在那之前就已经存在，追溯到1834年，几乎有两个世纪的历史。从历史上看，黑客行为在1836年曝光，当时两名参与此行为的人被抓获。在1700年代末期，法国实施了其国家数据网络，用于在巴黎和波尔多之间传输数据，当时这是独一无二的。该网络基于机械电报系统，构建了一个由物理塔楼组成的网络，每个塔楼顶部配备了一套独特的可动臂系统。
- en: 'The tower operators would use different combinations of these arms to form
    numbers and characters that could be read from a similar distant tower using a
    telescope. This combination of numbers and characters was relayed from tower to
    tower until it reached the far end. As a result, the government achieved a much
    more efficient mechanism of data transfer, which resulted in greater time saving.
    Interestingly, all this happened in the open. Even though the combinations were
    encrypted, and would''ve required an experienced telegraph operator to decode
    the message at the far end to bring up the original message, the risks were just
    around the corner. The following image is one such tower:'

- en: This operation was observed by two bankers, Francois and Joseph Blanc. They
    used to trade government bonds at the exchange in Bordeaux, and it was they who
    figured out a hack to poison the data transfer in between, and include an indicator
    of current market status, by bribing a couple of telegraph operators. Usually
    it took several days before the information related to Bond performance reached
    Bordeaux by normal mail, now, due to this hack, they had an advantage to get that
    same information well before the exchange in Bordeaux received it. In a normal
    transmission, the operator included a *Backspace* symbol to indicate to the other
    operator that he needed to avoid the previous character and consider it as mistake.
    The bankers paid one of the operators to include a deliberate mistake with a predefined
    character, to indicate the previous day's exchange performance, so that they could
    assume the market movement and plan to buy or sell bonds. This additional character
    did not affect the original message sent by the government, because it was meant
    to be ignored by the far end telegraph operator. But this extra character would
    be observed by another former telegraph operator who was paid by the bankers to
    decode it by observing through a telescope. Also, the Blanc brothers did not care
    about the entire message either; all they needed was the information related to
    market movement, which was well achieved through this extra piece of inert information.
    The Blanc brothers had an advantage over the market movement and continued to
    do this for another two years, until their hack was discovered and they were caught
    in 1836\. You can read more about such attacks at [https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/08/26/cyberattacks-in-the-1830s/](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/08/26/cyberattacks-in-the-1830s/).

    witnessed the first ever computer virus—**Morris worm**. Even though the creator
    of the worm, Robert Tappan Morris, denied the allegation that it was intended
    to cause harm to computers, it did, indeed, affect millions of them. With an intention
    to measure the vastness of the cyber world, Tappan wrote an experimental program

    Morris否认它是有意造成计算机伤害的，但它确实影响了数百万台计算机。Tappan编写了一个自我复制的实验性程序，旨在衡量网络世界的广度，该程序会自动从一台计算机跳到另一台计算机。
- en: This was injected to the internet by Morris, but, to his surprise, this so-called
    worm spread at a much faster rate than he would have imagined. Soon, within the
    next 24 hours, at least 10% of the internet connected machines were affected.
    This was then targeted to ARPANET, and some reports suggested that the of connected
    computers at the time was around 60,000\. The worm was using a flaw in the Unix
    email program, `sendmail`, which typically waits for other systems to connect
    to the mail program and deliver the email, and a bug in the `fingerd` daemon.
    This worm infected many sites, which included universities, military, and other
    research facilities. It took a team of programmers from various US universities
    to work non-stop for hours to get to a fix. It took a few more days to get back
    to a normal state. A few years later, in 1990, Morris was convicted by the court,
    for violating the *Computer Fraud and Abuse Act*; unlike at the time of Blanc
    brothers when there was no law to prosecute, this time there was.

    such as who has access to the data that is positioned in the cloud, how do you
    maintain and manage security regulatory requirements, and how do you keep up with

    vectors**, and they can span from software, to hardware, to network,and the users

    proportional to the extent of attack surface exposure. The higher the number of
    attack vectors, the larger the attack surface, and the higher the risk of compromise.

    the cybersecurity community, talk about it every day. Threat landscape can be
    defined as the collection of threats that are observed, information about threat
    agents, and the current trends of threats. It is important that every security
    professional keeps track of the threat landscape. Usually, many different agencies
    and security vendors will release such threat landscape reports, for example,
    **ENISA** (**European Union Agency for Network and Information Security**), and
    **NIST** (**National Institute of Standards and Technology**), along with some
    of the big security corporations.

  zh: 攻击面还引入了另一个术语——**威胁景观**。我们在网络安全社区中每天都会讨论这个话题。威胁景观可以定义为已观察到的威胁集合、威胁源的信息以及当前的威胁趋势。每一位安全专业人士都应当时刻关注威胁景观。通常，许多不同的机构和安全厂商会发布此类威胁景观报告，例如**ENISA**（**欧洲网络与信息安全局**）和**NIST**（**美国国家标准与技术研究院**），以及一些大型安全公司。
- en: 'Moreover, the threat landscape is an extremely dynamic space; it changes very
    frequently, and is driven by many factors, such as available tools to exploit
    vulnerabilities, the knowledge base of available resources and vulnerabilities,
    and the skill requirements to place an attack. (This is becoming increasingly
    easy due to the freely available tools on the internet.) We will talk more about
    the threat landscape resources in following chapters in this book. The following

- en: '**Unstructured attacks**: These are one of those attacks where the adversary
    has no prior knowledge of the environment they are launching an attack on. Mostly,
    in such scenarios, they rely on all the freely available tools. Unstructured attacks
    are often targeted en masse, based on any common vulnerability and available exploitation.'

- en: '**Structured attacks**: In the case of a structured attack, unlike an unstructured
    one, the adversary is much more prepared and well planned in carrying out the
    attack. In most of the cases of structured attacks we notice that the attackers
    demonstrate their advanced skills of programming, and knowledge about the IT systems
    and applications they are targeting. These attacks can be highly organized in
    nature and mostly targeted towards an individual entity or industry vertical.'

- en: '**Social engineering (phishing, spear phishing, and so on)**: This attack is
    targeted towards one of the weakest links, humans. In this attack, the user is
    exploited in various ways. Often these attacks are successful because of a lack
    of knowledge or ignorance. Information is extracted from the user by tricking
    them one way or the other. The most common way is by phishing and spear phishing.
    In a phishing and spear phishing attack, data is extracted by impersonating something
    that looks authentic to the user, such as, posing as an administrator helping
    the user to reset their password, and other account details, via a web portal.
    These portals are specially crafted to suit the purpose of extracting data which
    the attacker wishes to collect. Users fall prey to those, and share sensitive
    information.'

- en: '**Eavesdropping**: This attack can be performed by gaining unauthorized access
    to the network and listening to the network communications. Commonly, all the
    traffic that is not encrypted can be easily targeted by the attacker.'

- en: '**Denial of Service (DoS and DDoS)**: This is one of the oldest forms of network-based
    attacks, where the attacker will attempt to overwhelm the processing or computing
    capacity of the application or device by sending such a flood of data that it
    is more than the application or the device can handle, thereby disrupting the
    system. On the other hand, **distributed denial of service** (**DDoS**), is launched
    from multiple sources towards a single victim application or system on a very
    large scale, more than the amount that can be handled. This is one of the hardest
    to mitigate without proper technologies in place.'

- en: '**Man-in-the-middle attack** (**MITM**): In this attack form, the session or
    the network is hijacked in between by manipulating the communication between server
    and client, and acting as a proxy server, often without the knowledge of the victim.'

- en: '**Malware**: Malware can be defined as disruptive software, which is intentionally
    designed to cause damage or achieve any other malicious intent by its creator.
    Most of the time, this access is gained by exploiting the computing system''s
    security, or any vulnerabilities, with help from the malware. Worms and Trojans
    are different forms of malware, and these have a very specific capability to spread
    from computer to computer and replicate themselves. Malware can cause theft of
    data, mass destruction of computer systems, disruption of network activities,
    and also can help in corporate espionage. Most of the latest malware may have
    unique capabilities to hide itself extremely well from the security systems and
    detection mechanisms, and stay active for weeks to years.'

- en: '**Botnets**: When computer systems are infected with malware, or any other
    malicious remote tools, and these infected computer systems are controlled by
    the attacker remotely, it is known as a bot. Furthermore, when there are many
    computers which are compromised by this malware, and controlled by the attacker,
    this network, or collection of compromised computers, is called a **botnet**.
    The remote mechanism and the control method are also termed as *"Command and Control"*.
    Botnets can be used for various other purposes by the adversary, and, to achieve
    these, the botnet master will keep updating the malicious program''s binary. Botnets
    used to be single-focused in terms of their mission. However, in the recent past,
    they have changed to become multiple-purpose malicious applications.'

- en: '**Cross-site scripting**: Cross-site scripting, commonly known as **XSS** attack,
    is an exploitation of flaws in web applications, which allows the adversary to
    inject malicious client-side script and compromise the user, without their knowledge
    in most cases. In general, these flaws exist due to poor input validation of web-based
    applications. Once the XSS is sent to the user, the browser will process it because
    the browsers have no mechanism to stop XSS based attacks. There are multiple forms
    of XSS attacks. **Stored** and **reflected** types of XSS are very common. Stored
    XSS allows the attacker to leave permanent malicious scripts in the victim''s
    server, while reflected XSS usually takes place when the attacker sends a specially
    crafted link with a malicious query in the URL to the user, and the unsuspecting
    user clicks on the link, which then takes the user to a malicious site and captures
    the user''s sensitive data, which is then sent to the attacker. Reflected XSS
    is possible only if the user clicks on the link. Or, another method is if the
    attacker tricks the user into clicking it.'

  zh: '**跨站脚本攻击**：跨站脚本攻击，通常被称为**XSS**攻击，是一种利用网页应用程序漏洞的攻击方式，它允许攻击者注入恶意的客户端脚本，并在大多数情况下在用户不知情的情况下危害用户。通常，这些漏洞是由于网页应用程序对输入验证不严格所致。一旦XSS脚本被发送给用户，浏览器就会处理它，因为浏览器没有机制来防止XSS类型的攻击。XSS攻击有多种形式。**存储型**和**反射型**XSS攻击非常常见。存储型XSS攻击允许攻击者在受害者的服务器上留下永久性的恶意脚本，而反射型XSS攻击通常发生在攻击者向用户发送包含恶意查询的特制链接时，用户点击该链接后，会被引导到一个恶意网站，从而捕获用户的敏感数据，并将其发送给攻击者。反射型XSS攻击仅在用户点击链接时才会发生。另一种方式是攻击者诱使用户点击该链接。'
- en: '**Drive-by download attack**: This form of attack is very commonly seen over
    the internet. It has been one of the top threats in the past couple of years.
    In practice, attackers will compromise a well-known benign website and host their
    malware there, by embedding malicious links. Once users visit these non-suspecting
    websites, they get compromised by automatically being redirected to the malware
    download locations. Often, the links of compromised websites could be spread via
    spam or phishing emails, where a user might click a link out of curiosity, or
    unknowingly, and get the malware downloaded into the system.'

- en: '**SQL injection attack**: SQL injection attack is usually targeted towards
    the database exposed via the web. An attacker would execute malicious queries
    via poorly configured web applications, mostly in the data input mechanism to
    run SQL commands. The attacker, if successful, can gain access to the database,
    manipulate sensitive data, or, at times, also modify data. SQL injection can also
    allow arbitrary commands to manage the operating system remotely. This vulnerability
    is successful mostly due to the poor input sanitization at the web application,
    rather than at the database end, because databases are designed to execute queries
    as they receive them and return results accordingly. So, the developers must take
    care about input sanitization and only accept data input as desired, and check
    for any malicious inputs, before sending it to a database for query execution.'

    SQL 命令。如果攻击成功，攻击者可以访问数据库、操控敏感数据，或者有时修改数据。SQL 注入还可以允许任意命令远程管理操作系统。这个漏洞之所以成功，主要是因为
    Web 应用程序的输入清理不到位，而不是数据库端的原因，因为数据库是按照收到的查询执行并返回结果的。因此，开发人员必须注意输入清理，只接受符合要求的数据输入，并在将其发送到数据库执行查询之前，检查是否有恶意输入。'
- en: '**Advanced persistent threat** (**APT**): This attack has been on the rise
    over many years. The modus operandi of these attacks is mostly to launch highly
    targeted attacks against specific individual organizations, industry segments,
    or even a nation. These threats are called *"advanced persistent"* because the
    attacker, or the group of attackers, will use many advanced and stealthy techniques
    to stay undetected for a very long time. Often, it is found that the attack and
    persistent methods are specifically crafted for the particular attack and have
    never been used in any other attacks. APT based attacks are mostly well funded
    and they are mostly a team driven activity. APT is used to target intellectual
    property, any form of sensitive information, disruptive activities, or may even
    be for corporate espionage, or sabotage of data, and/or the infrastructure. APT
    attacks are entirely different from the other forms of attack; the adversary/adversaries
    take a very organized approach to know their target and the mission they want
    to achieve, and they do not rush to attack. The attack infrastructure is very
    complex at times. The main goal of the attacker/attackers is to stay in the compromised
    network as long as possible and stay hidden from security detection. One of the
    significant natures of APT, is that it can only impact certain parts of the network,
    or certain persons in the company, or just a few systems in the network that are
    the point of interest. This, therefore, makes it more challenging to detect APT
    activities by security monitoring systems.'

  zh: '**高级持续性威胁**（**APT**）：这种攻击已经存在多年，并且在不断增加。这些攻击的作案手法通常是针对特定的个人、组织、行业领域，甚至国家发起高度定向的攻击。这些威胁被称为*“高级持续性”*，因为攻击者或攻击团队将使用许多先进且隐蔽的技术，以便在很长一段时间内不被发现。通常，攻击和持续的方法是专门为特定攻击设计的，并且从未用于其他攻击。基于
    APT 的攻击通常资金雄厚，且大多是由团队推动的活动。APT 攻击的目标通常是知识产权、任何形式的敏感信息、破坏性活动，甚至是企业间谍活动，或者是数据破坏和/或基础设施破坏。APT
    攻击与其他形式的攻击完全不同；对手/对手们采取非常有组织的方式来了解他们的目标和他们想要达成的任务，并且他们不会急于发动攻击。攻击基础设施有时非常复杂。攻击者/攻击者的主要目标是尽可能长时间地待在被攻破的网络中，并避免被安全检测发现。APT
    的一个显著特点是，它只能影响网络中的某些部分、公司中的某些人，或者网络中仅有几个是重点关注的系统。因此，这使得安全监控系统更难检测到 APT 活动。'
- en: '**Web-based attacks**: In these attacks, as the name suggests, the target systems
    are mostly those which are internet facing devices, applications, services, and
    so on. Practically, we can say that the majority of internet applications are
    exposed to web attacks. These can be attacked via flaws and vulnerabilities, not
    only in the applications, but, also, in the medium by which we access those applications,
    such as web browsers. Web browser exploits have been on the rise for many years.
    Web servers are always a very lucrative target for the adversary/adversaries.
    Some of the famous attack forms are drive-by downloads or watering hole attacks
    (where a legitimate web application, used by the target/targeted organizations,
    is compromised and then the attacker waits for the employees/users to visit the
    website and, thus, it becomes compromised).'

    that are extremely vulnerable and very difficult to track, monitor, and mitigate.

    assets will cause harm to the entity/business, or the organization. This is sometimes
    done unknowingly by becoming prey, or, sometimes, they are the ones conducting
    the attack. In general, there are no definitive ways to detect or monitor insider
    threat proactively; it can only be found when the damage has already been done
    in most cases. It''s been a rising trend over many years, as the advanced attackers
    try to exploit insiders to gain access to the organization or businesses. This
    has been a major threat to governments and it''s increasing day by day. Even if
    the organizations have a bullet proof network with a lock down environment, and
    strong perimeter defenses, insider attacks are considered to be the most effective.
    The mitigation of an insider threat is beyond the technical implementation. The
    organization also needs to include the social culture and education of its own
    users about how to treat security and stay vigilant.'

    subscribers could log in to the TRW database as needed to query the required information
    about a user. These details were confidential in nature, and only to be accessed
    by the bank officials or the department store operators. Even though the data
    accessed was read-only and no one could change any data, one could still expose
    it and misuse it, which is exactly what happened. The password and the manual
    on how to operate the TRW system and access the database was leaked from a department
    store in one location, and, once the adversaries got hold of the login and access
    information, they posted it in bulletin boards, (something equivalent of today's
    social media). Now, not only did the attackers have the login information, but
    also a whole profile of those who were connected and had access to the bulletin

- en: Surprisingly, the incident was not detected by TRW officials for many months
    (it's not clear how long). The breach was reported to TRW by an external party.
    As per the investigation reports at the time, it was believed that the database
    was accessed via the store line, and TRW had no clue about how many times it had
    been accessed. Experts said during that time that a proper monitoring and detection
    could have flagged this activity (note that this is true even in today's environment).
    Investigators at that time also suggested that, if TRW had implemented a system
    to call back the telephone number via which access was requested, and verified
    before the information was transmitted (today we can compare this with our two-factor
    authentication), and rotated the user password frequently in conjunction with
    a few other methods, the attack could have been averted.

- en: The points that we need to focus on in this incident of 1984, and compare with
    today's attack scenarios, are that the attack vectors, methods, and the mitigation
    that could have averted this, are quite unchanged. Firstly, one is that the attacker
    used some sort of social engineering to get hold of login credentials, which is
    still a very common method today. Secondly, they had full and complete information
    about the TRW systems by getting access to the manual, which might have helped
    them stay undetected for a very long time. Thirdly, they targeted user data not
    to damage or tarnish the company. It's the same as today, attackers get silent
    access to the systems with various methods, and try to stay undetected as long

    the course of computer security in the years to come. In 1989, Robert Morris created
    a program to measure the size of the internet by counting the number of connected
    devices. He developed a program that would self-propagate using a vulnerability
    (we discussed this at the beginning of this chapter). But this incident did not
    get fixed or barred there, and there was more to come. The early 90s saw the rise
    of another virus, which was dubbed the *"Michelangelo virus"*, designed to attack
    DOS systems at the time and modify the boot sector of the disk to stay put. This
    virus infected any media that was attached to it, such as hard disks or floppy
    disks, during that time. The Michelangelo virus was designed to stay dormant all
    the time, except for a particular date, 6 March, which is when it would come alive
    and act. (It was this date because, the researchers believed, it is the birthday
    of the famous Renaissance artist Michelangelo, but it's a mere coincidence.)

    a vulnerability in the Microsoft SQL Server. This worm was so agile that it spread

- en: In November 2008, we witnessed yet another massive attack by another worm, which
    targeted Windows machines (ranging from Win 2000 to Win 7). This worm eventually
    impacted 10-15 million servers worldwide in over 190 countries, as a rough estimate.
    The worm impacted governments, military bases and fleets, corporate and home users,
    and, in fact, practically everyone in its path. Between November 2008 and April
    2009, there were five variants that were found, **Conficker A**, **B**, **C**,
    **D**, and **E**. This worm not only created a massive infection around the globe,
    but it also created one of the biggest botnets of the era. Maybe the motive behind
    the worm was to create a large botnet to do more serious attacks, but nothing
    was made conclusive regarding the actual motive to generate an attack of this
    scale. This worm also used many new techniques that had never been used before
    this time. This included methods to block disinfection, infections of USB and
    other removable devices to spread further, along with a few other propagation
    methods, including files shares, and admins shares. The most innovative was the
    method to *"call home"* to the botnet controller via a communication framework
    based on random domain generation algorithms, later famously known as DGA algorithms,
    and these became the norm for other malware infections and botnet commands and
    control infrastructure. This method allowed the worm to generate hundreds and
    thousands of random domain names every day by a pre-determined algorithm and seed
    value (usually the date and time).The same algorithm was used proactively by the
    attacker to register one, or a few, of the domains from the random list for each
    day. This domain name was used by the malware on the particular day for command
    and control activities.
