- en: Digital forensics is an expansive term that can cover a multitude of subject
    areas. Broadly speaking, it refers to the investigation of crimes committed on,
    or with the use of, a computing device. Several years ago, this may have only
    been applicable to cases in which an investigator was looking at financial fraud,
    intellectual property theft, or similar cases where computers are, by definition,
    necessary in order to commit the crime.

  zh: 数字取证是一个广泛的术语，可以涵盖多个学科领域。广义来说，它指的是对在计算设备上或借助计算设备实施的犯罪进行调查。几年前，这种方法可能只适用于调查财务欺诈、知识产权盗窃或类似的案件，这些案件中计算机在犯罪的实施过程中是必不可少的。
- en: In today's world however, the proliferation of digital devices is such that
    even a crime that seems to be unrelated to computing—a house burglary where jewellery
    is stolen, for example, or the abduction of a child walking home from school—can

- en: In older Windows versions (around the time of XP and 2000), there were fewer
    programs to deal with, and therefore fewer sources of potential evidence, but

- en: Prefetch files were introduced in XP, and swiftly became one of the most pertinent
    sources of evidence, which is still the case today. The aim from a user experience
    perspective was essentially to speed things up. Prefetch files take note of which
    programs are used most frequently and make sure that those programs are pre-loaded
    into the memory, so that when a user boots up a machine and then tries to access
    one of the programs, it will load more quickly. From a forensic point of view,
    this means that prefetch files provide a wealth of information regarding a user's
    general computer habits—which programs they use most often, and to some extent,
    how they are being used. Prefetch files are stored in the `%SystemRoot%Prefetch`
    directory and will be discussed in more depth in [Chapter 7](68f38c3f-3c60-45d9-a745-72cb085bb9d7.xhtml),

    The simplest way to ascertain whether a volume has been encrypted using BitLocker

- en: Around the same time BitLocker was introduced, with the release of Windows Vista,
    the way in which user accounts are structured within Windows also changed. This
    is mainly noticeable from the perspective of the user themselves, in that the
    main change is that many system-wide modifications that could previously be made
    by any user can now only be made by an administrator. This can also be an important
    point forensically, particularly in cases where a computer has multiple users,
    only one of whom has access to the administrative password.

    the main problems the investigators ran into was that the people who were watching
    the live streamed content were also subjects for investigation, but they were
    spread internationally and were difficult to track down due to so many of them
    using various methods of obfuscation. Laws around the world differ too: legislation
    in one country may create a legal loophole that causes havoc for a case and has

    and to inform future searches. Slang is still a problem for many though, and criminals
    are increasingly becoming wise to this. While a thesaurus can bring back a number
    of synonyms for a given term relating to drug abuse, the exploitation of children,

    be devoted to the forensic analysis of machines running Windows 10, but broadly
    speaking, the difference from a forensic perspective comes from the fact that
    applications and programs don't just have different names; they work in a slightly
    different way. End users are increasingly looking for more lightweight, quick
    to run devices that make their work and personal lives easier, which means that,
    in turn, technology companies such as Microsoft are turning to collaborations
    with other entities and making the personal computer less of a single, standalone
    piece of equipment and more of a portal to data stored elsewhere. It is quite
    possible to seize a device where the documents are stored on Google Drive; voice
