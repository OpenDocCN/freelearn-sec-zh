    You will start exploring what the world of hacking entails and what it really
    takes to become a hacker. You will learn about what skill set is needed to become
    a successful hacker in the real world. We will also discuss some legal aspects
    of hacking and penetration testing and how you can avoid getting into legal trouble.
    Then, we will explore what the different kinds of hackers are and what categories
    they fall into. In the later sections of this chapter, we will explore the general
    steps and guidelines we should follow in order to carry out a successful attack.
    Lastly, we will conclude this chapter by talking about different attack vectors.
    We will talk about both technical and personal penetration testing techniques.

- en: What comes to your mind when you think of the word *hacker*? In recent decades,
    the word *hacker* has almost become synonymous with the notion of a genius computer
    nerd who can get access to any system within seconds and can control anything.
    From someone who can control traffic signals through their computer to someone
    penetrating the Pentagon's network, the world of movies and fiction has created
    a specific image of a hacker. Like everything else in movies, this is just a work
    of fiction; the real world of *hacking* and *penetration testing* is quite different
    and vastly more complex and challenging.

- en: The real world is filled with unknowns. Carrying out a successful attack on
    a victim requires a lot of patience, hard work, dedication, and probably a bit
    of luck. The world of computer security and hacking is a constant cat-and-mouse
    chase. Developers create a product, hackers try to break it and find vulnerabilities
    and exploit them, developers find out about these vulnerabilities and develop
    a patch for them, hackers find new vulnerabilities, and this cycle continues.
    Both actors try to outsmart each other in this constant race. With each iteration,
    the process becomes more and more complex, and attacks are becoming more and more
    sophisticated to bypass detection mechanisms. Similarly, detection mechanisms
    are also getting smarter and smarter. You can clearly see a pattern here.

    used in the industry. Knowledge of these items is essential to understanding the
    world of penetration testing, so it is a good idea to go through them at this
    point. The word *hacking* refers to the process of getting unauthorized access
    to a system. The system could be either a personal computer or a network in an
    organization. You will often see the words *hacking* and *penetration testing*
    being used interchangeably in this book. Hacking is a more commonly understood
    umbrella term used for a lot of things. The focus of this book will be more on
    penetration testing, commonly referred to as *ethical hacking*, in which you have
    permission to attack the target. Penetration testing, or pen-testing for short,
    is an authorized simulated attack on a target. This is usually done to find the
    potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in a system so that they are exposed
    before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

    This means that nobody should have access to the data without authorization, even
    inside the organization. Organizations often have access control that dictates
    which level of access each user has to their data. The access levels are usually
    divided into these categories:'

    are not supposed to, for example, an ex-employee of a company logging in to the
    system using their previous credentials or guests getting a higher access level
    than necessary in the network. To ensure confidentiality, it is imperative that
    strict controls are in place to avoid violating confidentiality criteria. Confidentiality

    intended for Jack and no one else. The network is shared with various users. An
    unknown person, Mr. X, is also present in the network and he is listening to all
    the traffic on the network (also called *sniffing*). The principle of confidentiality
    indicates that only Jack should be able to decode this message. If Mr. X intercepts
    this package, reads it, and then just forwards it to Jack without modifying anything
    on the message, the confidentiality principle is said to be violated even though
    both John and Jack don't know that their traffic is intercepted. Network sniffing/monitoring
    violates the confidentiality principle.

  zh: 完整性
- en: The integrity principle ensures that data has not been tampered with in any
    form and is reliable. Data integrity should be ensured in both static and transaction
    modes. Static integrity means that all files in the system remain intact and any
    unauthorized modification should be detected immediately. It also requires that
    data integrity should be maintained when transferred over a medium. Different
    techniques are used to ensure data integrity. One of the most common examples
    is the use of a checksum. A checksum is a string of characters that are calculated
    for a file to ensure it's not been modified. You will often see checksums associated
    with files downloaded from the internet. Once a file is downloaded, you can calculate
    the checksum and compare it with the checksum present on the website; if both
    of them are equal, it means that data integrity was maintained during downloading.
    If even one bit has been changed during downloading, the whole checksum string
    would change. It is often used to prevent file spoofing/masking attacks where
    hackers intercept your download requests and instead of downloading your requested
    files, download malicious malware on your PC. You should always compare the checksums
    of files to ensure that the files you download are in fact the same as those present
    on the server.

  zh: 完整性原则确保数据没有被以任何形式篡改，并且是可靠的。数据完整性应在静态模式和事务模式下得到保证。静态完整性意味着系统中的所有文件保持完整，任何未经授权的修改应立即被检测到。它还要求在数据通过介质传输时，数据完整性应得到保持。为了确保数据完整性，使用了不同的技术。最常见的例子之一是使用校验和。校验和是一串计算出来的字符，用于确保文件没有被修改。你通常会看到下载的文件附带有校验和。一旦文件下载完成，你可以计算校验和并将其与网站上提供的校验和进行比较；如果两者相等，则意味着在下载过程中数据完整性得到了保持。如果下载过程中即使有一个比特发生了变化，整个校验和字符串都会改变。它通常用于防止文件伪造/掩盖攻击，在这种攻击中，黑客拦截你的下载请求，并且在你请求下载文件时，不是下载你请求的文件，而是下载恶意软件到你的电脑上。你应该始终比较文件的校验和，以确保你下载的文件与服务器上的文件确实相同。

    and thinks that John wants to meet at 6 P.M. instead of 4 P.M. Jack has no way

    users when requested. **Denial of Service** (**DoS**) attacks violate this principle.
    In DoS attacks, the attackers try to overwhelm the system with a burst of requests
    so as to make the servers/systems unavailable for legitimate users. This is one
    of the most common attacks on websites. Attackers bombard the website servers
    with requests, eventually taking them down. A wait period of a few seconds is
    now usually put in place for requests to be processed to discourage DoS attacks.
    Availability simply means that networks, systems, and servers are online when
    the user needs them. Disruption of even a few minutes can cause havoc for the
    organization. Let''s take the same example to understand this better:'

  zh: 最后一个可用性原则要求数据在授权用户请求时可用。**拒绝服务**（**DoS**）攻击违反了这一原则。在DoS攻击中，攻击者通过大量请求试图压垮系统，使得服务器/系统无法为合法用户提供服务。这是对网站最常见的攻击之一。攻击者通过请求轰炸网站服务器，最终将其瘫痪。现在，通常会设置一个等待几秒钟的时间，以便请求得到处理，从而抑制DoS攻击。可用性仅意味着网络、系统和服务器在用户需要时保持在线。即使是几分钟的中断也可能对组织造成灾难性后果。让我们通过相同的示例来更好地理解这一点：

    X intercepts this message and instead of forwarding it does nothing. John thinks
    that the message has been sent. However, Jack will never receive this message.
    In this case, the principle of availability is violated, because the message is
    not available to Jack. Another variation of violation of the availability principle
    is delaying messages. Let's say John sends an emergency message to Jack regarding
    some tasks that must be completed within a certain time frame. Mr. X delays the
    message so that the message is received by Jack after the passage of this time
    frame. Even though the correct message is received by John, the delay effectively
    renders the message useless. This is also a serious violation of the availability
    principle.

    Jack 不可用。可用性原则的另一种违规方式是延迟消息。假设 John 发送了一条紧急消息给 Jack，关于某些必须在特定时间框架内完成的任务。Mr. X
    延迟了消息，使得 Jack 在该时间框架过去后才收到消息。尽管 John 收到了正确的消息，但延迟使得消息变得毫无意义。这同样是对可用性原则的严重违反。

- en: One of the critical skills needed for a successful ethical hacker is to think
    like a hacker. So, what does it means to *think like a hacker*? The goal of hackers
    is to break into a system. A computer system is designed in an intuitive way so
    most people will be able to interact with it using minimal effort. All the security
    aspects of a system are designed with this methodology in mind. To be able to
    break into a system, your thinking process should be somewhat counter-intuitive
    or rather creative. You need to be able to identify weak points to be attacked
    that could help you to compromise the system.

  zh: 成为一名成功的道德黑客所需的关键技能之一是像黑客一样思考。那么，*像黑客一样思考*意味着什么呢？黑客的目标是突破系统。计算机系统的设计通常是直观的，因此大多数人都能通过最小的努力与之互动。系统的所有安全方面都是基于这种方法设计的。要突破一个系统，你的思维过程应该是有些反直觉的，或者说是富有创意的。你需要能够识别可以攻击的弱点，这些弱点可能帮助你攻破系统。
- en: Creating a tool that could help you to attack some system is one side of the
    hacking process while being able to successfully deploy your malware onto the
    target system without being detected is the other half of the equation. This is
    almost as important as the hacking tool itself. Once you identify a target, your
    goal will be to think of a methodology by which you can deploy it to the system.
    There are many methods of deploying your code depending on what kind of access
    you can get to the system. These methods, such as phishing and Trojan horses,
    will be discussed later. Don't worry if these terms sound unfamiliar to you. Once
    you have gone through this book, you will be familiar with most of these terms.

    be at the right place at the right time to take advantage of them. The window

    space is *zero-day exploit*. Zero-day exploit refers to a vulnerability that has
    not been patched yet. Often, a very limited number of people are aware of these
    and they tend to not disclose them so they can take maximum advantage of them.

    facilities. Stuxnet was a very complicated malware that infected the **Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition** (**SCADA**) systems. SCADA systems are used for
    the monitoring and control of large-scale industrial systems. The virus exploited
    a vulnerability in the **programmable logic controllers** (**PLCs**) used in the
    facility. The malware was very discreet and only became active if the target system
    was the Iranian nuclear facility. Even though it infected a large chunk of computer
    systems, it mostly remained dormant and only activated itself when it reached
    its intended target. According to most researchers, the complexity of the attack
    indicated that it was not the job of some criminal organization but a team of
    highly specialized programmers requiring months of development. These types of
    resources are often only at the disposal of national-level hackers. Stuxnet took
    control of the centrifuge speed control signals and starting spinning centrifuges
    at such high speeds that it eventually led to a breakdown. Stuxnet also intercepted
    speed status messages going to the SCADA systems so it would make it seem like
    centrifuges were operating at normal speeds while in reality, they were spinning
    at far higher speeds. This made Stuxnet very hard to detect and it stayed undetected

- en: In cybersecurity spaces, the term *script kiddie* refers to beginner hackers
    who do not have in-depth knowledge about cybersecurity or hacking in general.
    They often tend to use prebuilt tools for hacking purposes much like a black box
    approach. They don't essentially know how the hacking tool works internally but
    they just use it. Script kiddies sometimes lack programming knowledge to build
    their own tools and rely on existing tools for hacking purposes. The term *script
    kiddie* comes from the fact that they use pre-built *scripts* or programs to carry
    out attacks.

    angle of attack is sufficient to carry out a successful attack. There are a huge
    number of tools available online both free and paid that could help someone to
    carry out attacks. There are hacking organizations that make these tools especially
    to sell them to script kiddies for carrying out attacks. So, do not think that
    someone with little knowledge about developing tools is not a threat. In fact,
    they are as much of a threat as an experienced hacker. The success of an attack
    depends on both the attacker as well as the tools used.

  zh: 被动侦察
- en: Passive reconnaissance, as the name indicates, is a method of gathering information
    about the target individual and company by means of passive sources, without directly
    interacting with the intended target. This is the safest form of information gathering
    because there is no interaction with the target so it cannot be traced back to
    you. Passive reconnaissance includes gathering information from public sources.
    This could include gathering information available on the internet. Passive information
    itself is usually harmless, but combined with attack vectors, it can be exploited.
    For example, let's say that you visit the social media profile of the target and
    find out that the person is very interested in dogs. This information itself is
    not very useful. But if you send them an email containing a phishing link (phishing
    will be explained in a moment) containing some information about dogs, it is more
    likely that the target will click on this link and eventually compromise the system.
    Passive reconnaissance is usually done through search engines and public databases.
    Passive reconnaissance is much slower and usually gives limited technical data
    about the target. Although it is slower, the risk of getting caught in passive
    reconnaissance is very low.

    操作系统会使用*跳转列表*记录最近访问和修改的文件。数字取证专家使用这些技术来确定攻击者以及攻击在系统上的范围。

- en: Another method to cover tracks is by using *reverse HTTP shells*. A shell is
    a code that executes user commands on a system. We will talk more about this in
    later chapters. In most computers, port **80** is used for HTTP packets; therefore,
    port **80** is open a lot of time in computers. It is very hard for firewalls
    to distinguish between legitimate and malicious packets over port **80**. Using
    HTTP-based reverse shells, forensic analysts have a very hard time distinguishing
    hackers.

    trusts. Usually, they try to take advantage of people's interests. For example,
    if someone is a football fan, they are more likely to open an email or a link
    related to the topic of football and thus provide the attacker with a means to
    attack the victim. A common example of this attack is clone websites hosted by
    the attacker. An attacker would send a fake link to the target that resembles
    a website known to the target. However, the website will be hosted by the attacker
    and instead of going to the real website, the target will be directed to this
    website. These cloned websites look very similar to the original ones and if you
    are not careful, it is very hard to distinguish. Since this cloned website is
    operated by the hacker, any data that the user enters goes to the hacker. A good
    way to detect these fake websites is to check the website name along with the
    protocol. A real website will mostly operate on the **https** protocol.
