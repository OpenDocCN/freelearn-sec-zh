    While the overall number of jobs in different industries is rising, the technology
    industry is seeing one of the highest rates of job growth. In some countries,
    it is expected that by 2020, the number of IT jobs will outweigh the supply of
    people with skills to take them up. It is evident that the world is leaning more
    toward technology and that this is opening up opportunities for those skilled
    in different technologies. This is why the future is more promising for those
    that invest time to learn IT skills today.

    to safeguard user data. The most recent regulation touching on this was the **General
    Data Protection Regulation** (**GDPR**), which is quite demanding for organizations
    that want to be fully compliant with its requirements. The consequence of non-compliance
    with GDPR is that organizations found culpable will be heavily fined. GDPR is
    just one of the many regulations in cyberspace that have been designed to protect
    privacy and ensure security. There are many other regulations that apply to different
    jurisdictions. In the US, there is the **HIPAA Act**, the **Gramm-Leach-Bliley
    Act**, and the **Federal Information Security Act**, which regulate the collection,
    use, and protection of data in healthcare, financial, and federal agencies. There

- en: The regulatory space can, therefore, drastically change in months. Organizations
    do not always have the resources to stay abreast with the regulatory changes.
    The problem with data is that it can move across several regions and be subject
    to different regulations. For instance, while the GDPR only affects the data belonging
    to EU citizens, organizations world over have to comply with it, since they cannot
    foretell when they will interact with data from EU citizens. Many data regulations
    have to be followed, regardless of the geographical region they are passed in.

- en: It would take a lot of resources for organizations to research all of the regulations

    company in complying with the regulations. You have to keep updated with all the
    changes in these regulations and advise organizations accordingly when changes
    are made. The cyberspace is soon going to face major challenges for regulatory
    compliance. It is estimated that there is an average of 200 regulatory changes
    globally. While many of these do not currently affect the cybersecurity industry,
    soon they will. It is, therefore, best to start learning to become a regulatory

    software development project and that security is continually integrated from
    start to end. With the integrated approach, security is not built around the perimeter

    malicious persons to compromise the system. During software development, developers
    have security in mind and they continually share their insights on security threats
    and how they can make their software resistant to the threats. For instance, if
    the known threat takes advantage of a one-time authentication procedure, the developers
    can implement authentication at every module of a software so that an unauthorized
    person is not able to carry out any significant transactions in a system, even
    after bypassing the initial authentication process.

- en: Users have contributed to some of the worst cyber attacks that have happened
    in the world. For instance, the worst attack on Yahoo, an email service provider,
    was caused by just one click from a user. The FBI investigated the cause of the
    breach that led to the compromise of millions of user accounts and discovered
    that there were spear-phishing emails that were targeted at specific Yahoo employees.
    It is said that one of those targeted clicked on a malicious link that led to
    hackers compromising the employee's computer and using it to gain access to the
    network.

  zh: 用户曾导致世界上一些最严重的网络攻击。例如，Yahoo（一家电子邮件服务提供商）遭遇的最严重攻击，仅仅是因为一个用户的点击。联邦调查局（FBI）调查了导致数百万用户账户泄露的原因，发现有针对特定Yahoo员工的网络钓鱼邮件。有人说其中一名目标员工点击了一个恶意链接，导致黑客入侵该员工的计算机并利用其访问网络。
- en: Once in the network, the hackers installed a backdoor that allowed them to connect
    to and steal Yahoo's user database. Investigations revealed that the hacker responsible
    for these operations handed over the stolen database to other commercial hackers.

- en: The hack can, therefore, be traced back to a single user that did not follow
    security policies and clicked on a malicious link. There might have been impenetrable
    defenses in the network, but once a logged in user was compromised, it was easy
    for the hackers to complete their mission. This type of scenario can happen to

    finance department employees could be recorded to transact certain amounts of
    money to specific accounts and at certain dates. When an anomalous behavior is
    recorded from a certain user, a red flag is triggered by the system. For instance,
    if the account of a finance department employee makes abnormally large transactions
    or transacts at abnormal times, the UBA will send an alert and prevent the transaction
    from going through. This, therefore, stops an attack from being actualized.
