    the wisdom of a lawyer, and the knowledge of a computer analyst, all rolled into

    of an examination puts the practitioner in a unique and privileged position.

- en: Irrespective of the outcome, the practitioner's advice cannot be ignored. It
    is not uncommon for the examination to reveal very little information of value;
    nothing had been present to recover in many instances. However, it is common for
    the client and lawyer to say that the venture was productive in that it could
    be set aside and the search for evidence could focus elsewhere. It is also pleasing
    to secure evidence that helps secure a conviction or acquittal too, depending
    on the party who engaged the practitioner.

- en: Practitioners do not work in a vacuum. They do follow standard processes and
    develop their own through case experience and court outcomes. The question is
    whether the standards are adequate and easy to interpret and apply in practice.

    processes for recovering data from devices using sophisticated tools such as ILookIX

    could be recovered, and how it could be used in an investigation. Much information
    was condensed into that chapter, all of which could fill a book in itself. It
    would suffice to say that an understanding of the characteristics of digital evidence
    is a prerequisite for an entrée to the discipline. Furthermore, digital evidence

- en: The practitioner must keep up with these trends, yet little is published or
    shared, leaving it to the individual to explore new formats and processes and
    determine the best way to recover and process evidence. Exchanging discoveries
    is slow and tedious and usually restricted to publications and reviews, and they
    normally take an eternity to publish after peer review, are made into a quick
    blog post but not properly reviewed, or are kept "within house" because of confidentiality
    and privacy issues. This book does not provide encyclopedic coverage of digital
    evidence, but it has covered a considerable cross-section of the discipline.

- en: The practitioner needs to be able to explain the properties of digital evidence
    and the role it plays in adding to the weight of a case but must ensure that it
    passes the admissibility rules. Explaining the soundness and authenticity of the
    evidence, as well as being able to provide some corroboration to assist the court
    in assessing its worth, goes beyond merely selecting and presenting the evidence,
    for it is the role of the practitioner to interpret and explain the full and likely
    meaning of the evidence and metadata to the layperson.

  zh: 从业者需要能够解释数字证据的属性及其在加重案件证据中的作用，但必须确保其符合可采性规则。解释证据的可靠性和真实性，并能够提供一些佐证，帮助法院评估其价值，不仅仅是选择和展示证据，因为从业者的职责是解读并解释证据和元数据的完整含义，并向外行解释其可能的意义。
- en: As the discipline evolves and hopefully matures, it is practitioners who will
    lead the charge, but if they do not research and share any knowledge, it is going
    to be a ponderous exercise for them. Not all practitioners have the time even
    if they have the inclination to share their discoveries and experiences, and as
    mentioned before, there are confidentiality impositions too. In [Chapter 9](ch09.html
    "Chapter 9. Validating the Evidence"), *Validating the Evidence*, an evidence-validation
    process was introduced, and there may be merit in adopting such a process as a
    training tool for novice practitioners as well as a navigation tool for the more
    experienced. The process could be updated as new issues arise and used beyond
    its admissibility-checking design.

- en: Strategic business management identifies assets at risk and anticipates the
    threats to them. Prudent organizations predict the risk and set up processes to
    mitigate the threat in advance or better manage the consequences after a security
    breach. An organization's IT team is often engaged in profiling the threat to
    electronic information and implementing threat minimization and management processes.
    Their primary role is to restore the functionality of electronic resources and
    networks after security breaches, including physical and personnel security.

    Organizations are not always familiar with the complexity of digital evidence

    digital evidence recovery firsthand and with depressing regularity, I note here
    that those organizations that have a forensic contingency plan recover more quickly
    from an incident, with a greater probability of bringing offenders to account.
    It is really a prudent strategy for organizations big and small to have some form
    of forensic response in addition to a security incident contingency plan. While
    existing risk-assessment standards may be useful, they generally do not encompass
    a digital forensics response.

    container file described in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Recovering and Preserving

    apparently hashed the copied data and not the original, bringing into question
