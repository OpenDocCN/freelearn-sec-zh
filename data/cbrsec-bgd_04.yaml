    identified and fixed before hackers show up. Penetration testers are essentially
    white hackers who compromise or try to compromise systems as requested by the
    owners of these systems. In security careers, penetration testing is growing in
    relevance in the job market. Since organizations cannot be 100% sure that the
    security tools they have already implemented are sufficient enough to protect
    them, they are always looking for people to breach them. A career in penetration
    testing involves the roles of using common reconnaissance or hacking tools such
    as Metasploit or Wireshark to test the security stature of the organization. It
    will also include reviewing the code that has been used to create the systems
    that organizations run their operations on. The only non-exciting task in this
    job, for many that fancy it, is writing lengthy and detailed reports of the vulnerabilities
    found and the fixes required.

    also looking at reducing the financial burden of doing so. Hiring full-time employees
    just to assess the security level of an organization is being viewed as an added
    expense to the organization. Unlike other IT roles such as helpdesk support, some
    cybersecurity roles are not routine and thus can be carried out once or twice
    a month. In addition to this, there is a shortage of talents in cybersecurity.
    Therefore, employees that have these skills are changing workplaces more regularly
    as they are offered better remuneration packages. Therefore, organizations are
    increasingly having to contract third-party experts to assess their threat landscape
    and exposure. Cybersecurity consultancy roles are favorable to beginners as they
    are a way to gain real-world experience that might be required later in permanent
    positions. Cybersecurity consultants are often specialized in specific roles,
    and so anyone pursuing this role should identify a niche they are good at.

    Vulnerability assessment is part of the basic definition of the work of any cybersecurity
    personnel. The skill is used to actively seek threats that may exist in computer
    systems and networks. Cybersecurity experts are expected to know how to identify
    vulnerabilities and determine their chances of being exploited. There are several
    tools and techniques that can be used for detecting vulnerabilities. People seeking
    to start careers in this field should learn how to use these tools and how to
    implement some techniques. An example of a tool that can be used for vulnerability
    assessment is Nmap since it can scan networks to identify the connected devices
    and also scan the devices to identify their open ports, which can be exploited.
    However, Nmap uses a command-line interface, and so you have to learn how to issue
    the different scan commands using it. Code review is a common technique for identifying
    vulnerabilities where the expert can tell whether the code that's used in systems
    can fall to attacks. For instance, a cybersecurity professional should be able
    to tell whether the code for a login page can fall to SQL injection or cross-site
    scripting attacks. They can do this by verifying whether all inputs are validated
    before they are processed.

    are usually looking for both beginners and experts to fill up security roles.
    For those that are already in other careers, some of the skills and experience
    they have could be useful in particular niches of cybersecurity. For those that
    are starting their career journeys in cybersecurity, there are some skills that
    will thrust their career journeys forward. For beginners, a fresh start in your
    career should be focused on acquiring skills that can get you hired fast. Fortunately,
    cybersecurity is full of entry-level positions that organizations are looking
    to fill with beginners in the industry. The industry is also quite favorable for
    experienced professionals in other fields. One of the main reasons why it is hard
    for recruiters to find highly experienced professionals is because they almost
    always get hired immediately when they are in the market. Therefore, it is never
    too late to start your career and join this list of highly sought-after individuals.
    This section helps job seekers determine which skills they should pick up based
    on their current professional skills and experience. The following is a breakdown
    of some skills based on their friendliness and easy entrance into the job market
    for either beginners or experienced professionals.

    and IT operations. It is aimed at ensuring that business units operate as a team
    in the organization, and breaking down the individualistic views of departments
    as independent units in organizations. It aims at allowing departments to run
    collaboratively, and this often involves the integration of some business operations
    and sharing of data. DevOps, however, introduces organizations to more risks since
    the risks in one department are transferred through the whole organization. DevSecOps
    ensures that risks such as vulnerabilities to apps are mitigated during development.
    Therefore, the safety controls to secure enterprise-wide apps are implemented
    during development. DevSecOps aligns mostly with experienced professionals in
    DevOps. Taking the requisite training could improve a professional's career, allowing
    them to get into higher-ranking positions, such as project managers.

    of the world. At times, it is hard for organizations to determine whether they
    are compliant with all of them. For instance, there is a COPTA act in the US that
    bars organizations from collecting information of users under the age of 13\.
    There are GDPR regulations being passed by the EU governing how organizations
    inform users about the ways they collect, process, share, and store personal data.
    Alongside these are many other regulations. Each comes with a set of consequences
    if not adhered to. The cybersecurity industry has therefore been welcoming to
    auditors that are more conversant with the rules of compliance to ensure that
    organizations are found to be fully compliant with all applicable regulations.
    Regulatory compliance and auditing training is normally focused on existing professionals
    in auditing. It may also appeal to beginners in cybersecurity, provided that they
    have taken a course in auditing.
