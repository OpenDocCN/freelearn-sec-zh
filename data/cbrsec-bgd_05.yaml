    related to cybersecurity and cyber attacks have also burgeoned, with organizations
    having to pay more to keep their infrastructure secure. McAfee, a leading cybersecurity
    company, reported that the cost of cybercrime in 2017 was $600 billion. Individual
    attacks were estimated to have cost $5 million in the same year with $2.75 million
    having been lost to downtime and productivity loss. The cost of securing organizations
    was estimated to be $81 billion in 2016\. Since the cost of cybersecurity solutions
    has also increased, the total cost of securing organizations has also been going
    up. Therefore, the world economy is losing a lot of money to cybercrime. This
    money could have been put to more productive use, but it is either ending up in
    the hands of cybercriminals or being spent on cybersecurity solutions.

- en: Hacking is a process, not just a one-off act. Hackers have been known to take
    their time to first study their targets. They do observations of how the system
    they are targeting operates, how secure it is, the humans that use it, and the
    times that it is active. Once they have done reconnaissance, they scan the system
    and identify its technical specifications, as well as the vulnerabilities it may
    be having. Only when sure of the vulnerabilities, will the hackers try to breach
    the system to steal data and money, or to compromise it. These stages can be replicated
    on other targets, such as networks or users. It is evident that each stage takes
    time, and this is why hackers have to be patient. If they attack without knowing
    the security systems in place, the attack could flop and the organization could
    be triggered to secure the system even more. In addition to this, hackers are
    also patient when learning how to hack. Veteran hackers have studied programming
    languages in order to be able to read code or reverse engineer programs to find
    out where vulnerabilities exist. To become such an expert that you can analyze
    code written in different languages, one definitely has to spend a lot of time
    learning how to code. Hackers invest their time in this to prepare for their cybercrime
    activities.

    today due to the sophistication of cybersecurity tools. Systems that could have
    been exploited a few years ago through vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,
    have also been patched and are fully secure. However, hacking is still on the
    rise, which means that hackers are constantly coming up with new techniques and
    tools that cybersecurity companies are not aware of. They are also actively searching
    for new vulnerabilities to exploit. This just shows how determined hackers are.
    Hackers have also been targeting large corporations that are expected to have
    state-of-the-art security. However, this is not enough to stop the hackers, as
    previous incidences have shown. For instance, Facebook, with a user base of 2
    billion people, was hacked in 2018 and data belonging to 50 million users stolen.
    To many people, it could be assumed that Facebook has so many security features
    that it would just be time wastage to try and hack it. However, hackers have proven

- en: A growing trend in cybercrime is social engineering, where users have been tricked
    into handing sensitive details, or even transferring money to hackers. With the
    increasing cybersecurity budgets for organizations to buy more effective tools
    and security services, the channels for attacking systems and networks directly
    are reducing. However, hackers are exploiting other avenues to hack into highly
    secured organizations, and they are doing this through social engineering. There
    have been multiple hacks where it has been reported that the hackers simply coerced
    users into sending them money or giving them passwords. An increasingly common
    technique is business email compromise, where hackers are spoofing emails of executive
    employees and instructing junior employees to send money or passwords to certain
    accounts or emails. The use of coercion is working so effectively because hackers
    are exploiting flaws in the communication channels used by organizations. It has
    become normal for executives to order around junior employees and even to break
    protocol. Therefore, if the junior employees are asked by a spoofed email to send
    money to an overseas account, they will yield, simply because that is what the
    real executive does. Hackers have perfected their coercion skills as well, to
    a point that it is hard for the targets to say no. Hackers will refine the stories
    they will tell the users they target before sending them. If it is a call they
    are making, they will know what to say, depending on how the targets respond.
    Some social engineers even make physical appearances before targets to gain their
    trust. Therefore, coercion is simply one of the many essential tricks that hackers
    possess. They are coercive.

    From the planning phase of an attack, cybercriminals will start exercising caution,
    and use communication tools and techniques that make it hard for the messages
    to be traceable. Encryption, self-destructing emails, spoofed emails, and dark
    web communication tools are commonly used. During an attack, hackers will also
    cover their trails. They will use IP addresses from VPNs or proxies routed through
    other VPNs and proxies. The flow of data will be such that it is hard to trace
    where hackers came from and where stolen data was routed to. Additionally, hackers
    will operate systematically, where each of them knows what to do and when. Funds
    stolen directly from targets are not directly cashed into the hacker's banks since
    this would make it easy for them to be tracked. Instead, ghost accounts opened
    in overseas banks that do not have as many restrictions are used. Alternatively,
    money obtained from cybercrime passes through money laundering schemes till it
    cannot be traced back to the cybercrime incident. With the advent of cryptocurrencies
    that come with privacy controls aimed at anonymizing transacting parties, it is
    even easier for hackers to cleanse their money by converting it to cryptocurrencies

    inferiority complex is where an individual lacks self-esteem, doubts their own
    capabilities, and feels that they do not measure up to some standards. Such a
    person will feel weak and, thus, to compensate for this, they will try and do
    something to prove that they are strong. Some hackers have these social characteristics,
    and this makes them very dangerous. If the hacker feels that the world sees him
    or her as a weakling, he will be ready to prove that he is not by hacking. Sometimes
    this feeling gets to employees in organizations and they eventually become insider
    threats. For instance, an employee kept under constant pressure and highly criticized
    by their boss for never delivering, or not being good enough, could be pushed
    to the edge and decide to strike back to prove that they are strong. Hackers that
    suffer from inferiority complexes are prone to carrying out cyber attacks that
    can cause heavy damage, as they will be trying to show others just how powerful
    they are. Such hackers are also not worried about the consequences of their actions,

- en: This mostly applies to cyber terrorists and hacktivists. Hacktivists are radical
    and will do anything to overhaul what they do not like. For instance, hacktivists
    could stand up against the arrest of an influential journalist due to the existence
    of laws that limit the freedom of expression. They could be ready to force such
    laws to be done away with by unleashing waves of attacks against government agencies
    and top government officials. Cyber terrorists borrow from the ideals of the terrorist
    groups they are affiliated with, and mostly these ideals are from radical views.
    For instance, cyber terrorists from a group such as Al Qaeda could be against
    the interference of Westerners in local wars and could end up destroying infrastructure
    in the Western countries to promote the message that they are not wanted and must
    leave. Other cybercriminals will have their own radical views that they will base
    their actions on. Radicalism helps the cybercriminals escape the guilt of the
    negative impacts of what they do. For instance, if cyber terrorism leads to the
    destruction of a nuclear energy plant, and, consequently, to the deaths of the
    workers in such a plant, the perpetrators will be shielded from the guilt of killing
    innocent people by their radical beliefs.

- en: Crime is itself an act of rebellion against laws and societal ethics. Cybercrime
    is, therefore, an extension of this rebellion, except that the crime is conducted
    via a computer network or computing device. Cybercriminals take bold stands against
    the law and tend to gang up when they do so. They can form organized hacking groups
    or cyber-crime support structures. These groups, or structures, bring like-minded
    people together, and they can be highly effective, since all the members already
    disregard laws, morality, and ethics. They also possess tools, techniques, and
    skills that they can use against the people, bodies, or agencies they are rebelling
    against. Rebellion has many causes, but the main cause in the case of skilled
    people turning to hacktivism and cybercrime is economic need. To some extent,
    there exists an imbalance in the society, where wealth lies with a small percentage
    of people. Some people rebel, with the hope that their rebellion will lead to
    the redistribution of the wealth held by only a few. In other cases, people turn
    to cybercrime as a rebellion as a result of deprivation and oppression. There
    are countries where citizens live under oppressive governments, and the only way
    to fight such governments is to rebel. People might decide to join others that
    have rebelled, and contribute in fights against oppression, by hacking people
    in the oppressive governments and destroying some crucial infrastructure that
    benefits such governments. For instance, hackers may engage in hacking activities
    that will lead to the economic sabotage of the country, thus forcing the oppressive
    government to step down. Therefore, sometimes hackers are created by extreme circumstances
    that require them to rebel, with the hopes of making a difference. However, the
    means of achieving the change they hope to see ends up blurring the lines between
    the good they want to achieve and the bad they have to do to achieve it.

    cybercrime attack, cybercriminals are at the point in their careers where they
    are making more money than ever. Hacking is evidently profitable, and hacking
    incidences have shown this. Business Insider claimed in 2015 that hackers, relatively,
    make $80,000 a month. Hacking is like a business, and there are suppliers and
    customers interacting with the seller, who, in this case, is a hacker. Hackers
    do not have to directly engage in hacking to make money as there are many other
    ways of making a sustainable income in such a business. To begin with, they can
    make and sell exploits to other hackers. Some exploit kits are rented, where other
    hackers can use them for a given period as agreed during renting. Some hackers
    own botnets. Botnets are networks made up of many computers that have been infected
    with malware that can be used to force them to participate in attacks. Botnets
    are used in DDoS attacks, where they send more traffic than a target can handle,
    causing it to cease handling all legitimate requests. Since the advent of the
    IoT, many of these small devices that are connected to the internet were found
    to be lacking basic security features. They have thus been continually infected
    with malware which makes them botnets, and some of them have been used in attacks
    against renowned targets. A hacker who owns such malware gets many requests from
    other hackers to rent them the tool for a given duration, and the tool is paid

    that hackers today do not even need to know how to code, because they can rent
    the hacking tools. As was covered before, there are expert hackers who rent out
    exploit kits. There are others who rent out botnets to be used to carry out DDoS
    attacks. Therefore, newcomers to hacking think that they will find it quite easy
    to start off today due to the readily available tools. The existing hackers are
    already making money and will not be willing to stop doing so because of their
    greed. Due to this greed, hackers will keep on coming up with new hacking tools
    to sustain their sources of income. Greed also motivates them to keep looking
    for vulnerabilities to exploit in systems. A hacker knows that a new vulnerability,
    unknown to others, could easily translate to millions, and so they are ready to
    undertake scanning across several systems used by different organizations just
    to find one that has vulnerabilities. Greed is also a motivator in phishing, where
    a hacker goes to make clones of authoritative companies, write phishing emails
    laid out exactly like those of authoritative companies, or  use spoof email addresses
    of executives in organizations to be used for hacking. The hacker is greedy for
    money and will do all it takes to create the perfect tool or technique to carry

    out are aimed at passing a message of the cyberspace superiority of one country
    over another. For instance, there have been very many hacking incidences against
    the US which have been attributed to state-sponsored hacking groups in some Asian
    countries. Many companies in the US have fallen victim to these attackers. It

    secrets from these companies. Therefore, the products that the companies make
    will be easily replicated and, if they are used for communication purposes, the
    hackers will know how to compromise such products. Hackers that carry out cyber
    attacks with political motivation can be a big menace to targets because the hackers
    get resources from high-ranking politicians. In the case of state-sponsored hacking
    groups, the attackers are conditioned to behave like an army and will take orders
    to attack from those high in command. Hackers that have this type of thinking

  zh: 从黑客心理学中可以学到什么？
- en: From the discussions above, hacking can be better understood by looking at it
    from a psychological perspective. The traits of hackers, as presented, show that
    maintaining healthy social lives can help reduce cybercrime. People that lack
    social lives or like to lead isolated lives could be checked up on to make sure
    that they do not fall into cybercrime. It has been said that hackers are both
    patient and determined. These two traits have far-reaching implications for cybersecurity
    approaches in organizations. Since hackers will not relent easily, and will also
    take their time to find a vulnerability in the organization, it is prudent for
    organizations to adopt cyber resilience rather than cyber defense. Unlike cyber
    defense, cyber resilience ensures that an organization is protected from attackers,
    and, in the event that an attack happens, business processes will not be adversely
    affected. It has also been discussed that hackers are coercive. This, therefore,
    means that employees can easily fall prey. Organizations must, consequently, invest
    in programs to train their employees on how to protect themselves from hackers.
    Alongside this, organizations must set up clear procedures on how credentials
    can be shared, and also how a transfer of funds can be authorized. Hackers have
    been said to be careful in their attacks and this affects how organizations should monitor
    their systems and networks. Minor observations of abnormal activities on networks
    should not be ignored as hackers might be making a move. Additionally, organizations
    should invest in intrusion prevention systems to prevent some activities, such
    as network scanning, that might be used by attackers. Based on how attackers think,
    it can be learned that the main motivator for them is money, thus all resources
    that they can steal and make money from should be highly secured. Organizations
    that store personal data should employ extra security measures, such as encrypting
    their databases. Additionally, since some hacking events are politically motivated,
    governments in other countries have to take the initiative to follow up with the
    attackers and seek diplomatic resolutions.

  zh: 从上述讨论来看，黑客行为可以从心理学角度更好地理解。文中所展示的黑客特征表明，保持健康的社交生活有助于减少网络犯罪。那些缺乏社交生活或喜欢过孤立生活的人，可以进行定期检查，以确保他们不会陷入网络犯罪。有人说，黑客既有耐心又有决心。这两个特征对组织的网络安全策略有着深远的影响。由于黑客不会轻易放弃，他们也会花时间在组织中寻找漏洞，因此，组织采用网络韧性而非网络防御是明智之举。与网络防御不同，网络韧性确保组织能有效抵御攻击者的侵害，并且即使发生攻击，业务流程也不会受到不利影响。还讨论到黑客具有强迫性，这意味着员工容易成为攻击目标。因此，组织必须投资于培训项目，教员工如何保护自己免受黑客侵害。同时，组织必须制定清晰的流程，规范凭证的共享方式，以及资金转移的授权方式。黑客在攻击时往往非常小心，这也影响了组织应该如何监控其系统和网络。网络中任何异常活动的小细节都不应忽视，因为黑客可能正在行动。此外，组织还应投资入侵防御系统，以防止一些可能被攻击者用来进行扫描等活动。根据攻击者的思维方式，可以得出结论，他们的主要动机是金钱，因此所有可以被窃取并转化为金钱的资源应该得到高度保护。存储个人数据的组织应采取额外的安全措施，例如加密其数据库。此外，由于一些黑客事件具有政治动机，其他国家的政府必须主动跟踪攻击者，并寻求外交解决办法。

  zh: 总结
- en: The chapter has focused on what drives hackers and has discussed their psychological
    make-up and thought patterns. In the psychological make-up section, we have looked
    at the traits which define most hackers. These traits include patience, determination,
    insensitivity, risk-taking, coercion, carefulness, defiance, lack of social skills,
    radicalism, and rebellion, among others. Most of these traits help profile attackers
    and can be used to prepare an organization for hacking incidences. The patience
    and determination show just how far a hacker is willing to go. Insensitivity rules
    out appeals for mercy as a countermeasure to hacking events. The risk-taking trait
    shows that the hackers are not afraid of the law catching up with them, as it
    hardly ever does. Coercion and carefulness show how meticulous hackers are in
    their attacks and can get the best of targets, even before they can suspect they
    are being attacked. These traits also show that it may be hard to try and recover
    what has been stolen after an attack and thus more attention should be paid to
    protecting an organization from the attack in the first place. Radicalism and
    rebellion also add to the understanding of hackers as people who are not so remorseful
    and have an internal motivation to carry out their attacks. The chapter then looked
    at how hackers think and showed that their motivators are financial gain, greed,
    politics, religious extremism, and curiosity. Lastly, the chapter has looked at
    what can be learned from the psychology of the hackers covered.

  zh: 本章重点讨论了黑客的驱动力，并探讨了他们的心理构成和思维模式。在心理构成部分，我们分析了定义大多数黑客的特征。这些特征包括耐心、决心、麻木、冒险精神、胁迫、小心谨慎、蔑视、缺乏社交技巧、激进主义和叛逆等。大多数这些特征有助于描述攻击者的特征，并可用于为组织应对黑客事件做好准备。耐心和决心表明黑客愿意为达成目的付出多大的努力。麻木性排除了将宽恕作为应对黑客事件的对策。冒险精神表明黑客不惧怕法律追捕，因为他们几乎总能逃脱。胁迫和小心谨慎表明黑客在攻击时的精心策划，能够在目标察觉到之前，充分掌握攻击的主动权。这些特征也表明，黑客攻击后恢复已被窃取的内容可能非常困难，因此应更加关注如何从一开始就保护组织免受攻击。激进主义和叛逆也有助于理解黑客作为缺乏悔意且内心驱动进行攻击的人。接下来，本章探讨了黑客的思维方式，并指出他们的动机包括财务收益、贪婪、政治、宗教极端主义和好奇心。最后，本章讨论了从黑客心理学中可以获得的启示。
