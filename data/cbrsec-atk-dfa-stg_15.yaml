- en: In the previous chapters, you learned about the recovery process and how important
    it is to have a good recovery strategy and the appropriate tools in place. Oftentimes,
    an exploitation of a vulnerability might lead to a disaster recovery scenario.
    Therefore, it is imperative to have a system in place that can prevent the vulnerabilities
    from being exploited in the first place. But how can you prevent a vulnerability
    from being exploited if you don't know whether your system is vulnerable? The
    answer is to have a vulnerability management process in place that can be used
    to identify vulnerabilities and help you mitigate them. This chapter focuses on
    the mechanisms that organizations and individuals need to put in place to make
    it hard to be hacked. It might be impossible for a system to be 100% safe and
    secure; however, there are some measures that can be employed to make it difficult
    for hackers to complete their missions.

    is to make it a vulnerability management life cycle. Just like the attack life
    cycle, the vulnerability management life cycle schedules all vulnerability mitigation
    processes in an orderly way. This enables targets and victims of cybersecurity
    incidents to mitigate the damage that they have incurred or might incur. The right
    counteractions are scheduled to be performed at the right time to find and address
    vulnerabilities before attackers can abuse them.

  zh: 资产清单
- en: The first stage in the vulnerability management strategy should be the making
    of an inventory. However, many organizations lack an effective asset register
    and, therefore, have a hard time when securing their devices. An asset inventory
    is a tool that security administrators can use to go through the devices an organization
    has and highlight the ones that need to be covered by security software. In the
    vulnerability management strategy, an organization should start by giving one
    employee the responsibility of managing an asset inventory to ensure that all
    devices are recorded and that the inventory remains up to date (1). The asset
    inventory is also a great tool that network and system admins can use to quickly
    find and patch devices and systems.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 漏洞管理策略的第一阶段应是制作资产清单。然而，许多组织缺乏有效的资产登记，因此在保护其设备时遇到困难。资产清单是安全管理员可以用来检查组织拥有的设备，并突出需要由安全软件覆盖的设备的工具。在漏洞管理策略中，组织应通过指定一名员工负责管理资产清单，以确保所有设备都被记录在案，并且清单保持最新（1）。资产清单也是网络和系统管理员快速查找和修补设备与系统的一个好工具。
- en: Without the inventory, some devices could be left behind when new security software
    is being patched or installed. These are the devices and systems that attackers
    will target. There are hacking tools, as was seen in [Chapter 5](d07abf73-093e-4004-b690-1aa70db11902.xhtml),
    *Compromising the System*, that can scan the network and find out which systems
    are unpatched. The lack of an asset inventory may also lead to the organization
    underspending or overspending on security. This is because it cannot correctly
    determine the devices and systems that it needs to purchase protection for. The
    challenges that are expected at this stage are many. IT departments in today's
    organizations are often faced with poor change management, rogue servers, and
    a lack of clear network boundaries. Organizations also lack effective tools for
    maintaining the inventory in a consistent manner.

    *系统妥协* 中所见到的，有些黑客工具可以扫描网络并找出未打补丁的系统。缺乏资产清单也可能导致组织在安全方面支出不足或过多。这是因为它无法正确确定需要购买保护的设备和系统。在这个阶段预期会遇到许多挑战。如今的组织中的IT部门经常面临变更管理不善、流氓服务器和网络边界不清晰等问题。组织还缺乏有效的工具以一致的方式维护清单。

  zh: 信息管理
- en: The second stage in the vulnerability management strategy is controlling how
    information flows into an organization. The most critical information flow is
    internet traffic coming from an organization's network. There has been an increase
    in the number of worms, viruses and other malware threats that organizations need
    to guard against. There has also been an increase in the traffic flow both inside
    and outside of local networks. The increased traffic flow threatens to bring more
    malware into an organization. Therefore, attention should be paid to this information
    flow to prevent threats from getting in or out of a network. Other than the threat
    of malware, information management is also concerned with the organization's data.
    Organizations store different types of data, and some of it must never get into
    the hands of the wrong people. Information, such as trade secrets and the personal
    information of customers, could cause irreparable damage if it is accessed by
    hackers. An organization may lose its reputation, and could also be fined huge
    sums of money for failing to protect user data. Competing organizations could
    get secret formulas, prototypes, and business secrets, allowing them to outshine
    the victim organization. Therefore, information management is vital in the vulnerability
    management strategy.

  zh: 脆弱性管理策略的第二阶段是控制信息如何流入组织。最关键的信息流是来自组织网络的互联网流量。组织需要防范越来越多的蠕虫、病毒和其他恶意软件威胁。本地网络内外的流量流动也在增加。增加的流量威胁着将更多恶意软件带入组织。因此，应重视这种信息流，以防止威胁进入或离开网络。除了恶意软件的威胁，信息管理还涉及组织的数据。组织存储不同类型的数据，其中一些绝不能落入错误人手中。例如商业机密和客户个人信息，如果被黑客访问，可能会造成无法弥补的损害。组织可能会失去声誉，还可能因未能保护用户数据而被罚款巨额。竞争对手可能会获取秘密配方、原型和商业机密，使他们能够超越受害组织。因此，在脆弱性管理策略中，信息管理至关重要。
- en: In order to achieve this, an organization could deploy a **computer security
    incident response team** (**CSIRT**) to handle any threats to its information
    storage and transmission (2). Said team will not just respond to hacking incidents
    but will inform management when there are intrusion attempts to access sensitive
    information and the best course of action to take. Apart from this team, an organization
    could adopt the policy of least privilege when it comes to accessing information.
    This policy ensures that users are denied access to all information apart from
    that which is necessary for them to perform their duties. Reducing the number
    of people accessing sensitive information is a good measure towards reducing the
    avenues of attack (2). Lastly, in the information management strategy, organizations
    could put in place mechanisms to detect and stop malicious people from gaining
    access to files. These mechanisms can be put in place in the network to ensure
    that malicious traffic is denied entry and suspicious activities such as snooping
    are reported. They could also be put in place on end user devices to prevent the
    illegal copying or reading of data.

  zh: 为了应对这些挑战，组织可以部署**计算机安全事件响应团队**（**CSIRT**）来处理对信息存储和传输的任何威胁（2）。该团队不仅会应对黑客事件，还会在有入侵尝试访问敏感信息时，向管理层报告并提供最佳的应对措施。除了这个团队，组织还可以采取最低权限策略来管理信息访问。该策略确保用户只能访问完成工作所需的信息，其他信息一律拒绝访问。减少访问敏感信息的人员数量是减少攻击途径的有效措施（2）。最后，在信息管理策略中，组织可以部署机制来检测并阻止恶意人员访问文件。这些机制可以在网络中部署，以确保恶意流量被拒绝进入，并且像窥探等可疑活动得到报告。它们还可以在终端设备上部署，以防止非法复制或读取数据。
- en: There are a few challenges in this step of the vulnerability management strategy.
    To begin with, over the years information has grown in breadth and depth, making
    it hard to handle and also to control who can access it. Valuable information
    about potential hackings, such as alerts, has also exceeded the processing capabilities
    of most IT departments. It is not a surprise for legitimate alerts to be brushed
    off as false positives because of the number of similar alerts that the IT department
    receives daily.

  zh: 在漏洞管理策略的这一阶段，存在一些挑战。首先，多年来信息的广度和深度不断增长，这使得信息变得难以处理，同时也难以控制谁可以访问它。有关潜在黑客攻击的有价值信息，如警报，已经超过了大多数IT部门的处理能力。每天IT部门接收到大量类似警报时，合法的警报常常被当作误报忽视，这并不令人意外。
- en: There have been incidents where organizations have been exploited shortly after
    ignoring alerts from network monitoring tools. The IT department is not entirely
    to blame as there is a huge amount of new information that such tools are generating
    per hour, most of which turn out to be false positives. Traffic flowing in and
    out of organizational networks has also become complex. Malware is being transmitted
    in nonconventional ways. There is also a challenge when it comes to conveying
    information about new vulnerabilities to normal users who do not understand technical
    IT jargon. All these challenges together affect the response times and actions
    that an organization can take in the case of potential or verified hacking attempts.

    respond to all vulnerabilities since it would have sufficient resources and time.
    However, in reality, there are a great many limiting factors when it comes to
    the resources available to mitigate risks. That is why risk assessment is crucial.

    *Reconnaissance*. The tools used here are the same tools that hackers use to determine
    an organization's vulnerabilities so that they can decide which exploits to use.
    Commonly, organizations will call in penetration testers to conduct this process.

    usually have low ratings. There are three classes in a vulnerability grading system.
    The minor class is for vulnerabilities that require lots of resources to exploit,
    yet have a very little impact on the organization. The moderate class is for those
    vulnerabilities that have moderate potential for damage, exploitability, and exposure.

    printers, workstations, firewalls, routers, and switches on the organizational
    network are all targeted with these attacks. The aim is to simulate a real hacking
    scenario with the same tools and techniques that a potential attacker might use.
    The majority of these tools were discussed in the reconnaissance and compromising
    the system chapters. The goal in this step is not only to identify the vulnerabilities

- en: The challenges faced in this step are many. The first one to consider should
    concern what the organization should assess. Without an appropriate asset inventory,
    an organization will not be able to identify which devices they should focus on.
    It will also become easy to forget to assess certain hosts, and yet they may be
    key targets for potential attack. Another challenge has to do with the vulnerability
    scanners used. Some scanners provide false assessment reports and guide the organization
    down the wrong path. Of course, false positives will always exist, but some scanning
    tools exceed the acceptable percentage and keep on coming up with nonexistent
    vulnerabilities. These may lead to the wasting of the organization's resources
    when it comes to mitigations. Disruptions are another set of challenges that are
    experienced at this stage. With all the ethical hacking and penetration-testing
    activities going on, the network, servers, and workstations suffer. Networking
    equipment such as firewalls also get sluggish, especially when denial of service
    attacks are being carried out.

  zh: 在这个步骤中面临的挑战有很多。首先需要考虑的是组织应评估哪些内容。如果没有适当的资产清单，组织将无法识别应该关注哪些设备。此外，某些主机可能会被忽视，尽管它们可能是潜在攻击的关键目标。另一个挑战与使用的漏洞扫描器有关。一些扫描器提供错误的评估报告，导致组织走上错误的道路。当然，假阳性始终存在，但有些扫描工具的错误报告超出了可接受的百分比，并不断提出不存在的漏洞。这些可能导致组织在修复过程中浪费资源。干扰也是这个阶段的另一个挑战。随着所有道德黑客和渗透测试活动的进行，网络、服务器和工作站都遭受了影响。网络设备，如防火墙，也变得迟缓，尤其是在进行拒绝服务攻击时。
- en: Sometimes, strong attacks will actually bring down servers, disrupting core
    functions of the organization. This can be addressed by conducting these tests
    when there are no users using them, or coming up with replacements when core tools
    are being assessed. There is also the challenge of using the tools themselves.
    Tools such as Metasploit require you to have a solid understanding of Linux and
    be experienced with using command-line interfaces. The same is true for many other
    scanning tools. It is difficult to find scanning tools that offer a good interface
    and at the same time offer the flexibility of writing custom scripts. Lastly,
    sometimes scanning tools do not come with a decent reporting feature, and this
    forces the penetration testers to manually write these reports. Their reports

    This phase has two equally important tasks: reporting and remediation. The task
    of reporting helps the system admins to understand the organization''s current
    state of security and the areas in which it is still insecure, and it points these
    out to the person responsible. Reporting also gives something tangible to the
    management so that they can associate it with the future direction of the organization.
    Reporting normally comes before remediation so that all the information compiled
    in the vulnerability management phase can seamlessly flow to this phase.'

  zh: 漏洞评估之后是报告和修复阶段。这个阶段有两个同样重要的任务：报告和修复。报告的任务帮助系统管理员了解组织当前的安全状态，以及仍然不安全的领域，并将这些问题指出给负责人。报告还为管理层提供了具体的信息，使他们能够将其与组织未来的方向联系起来。报告通常在修复之前进行，以便漏洞管理阶段汇总的所有信息可以无缝地传递到这一阶段。
- en: Remediation starts the actual process of ending the cycle of vulnerability management.
    The vulnerability management phase, as was discussed, comes to a premature ending
    after analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities as well as outlining the acceptable
    risks. Remediation compliments this by coming up with solutions to the threats
    and vulnerabilities identified. All the vulnerable hosts, servers, and networking
    equipment are tracked down and the necessary steps are established to remove the
    vulnerabilities as well as protect them from future exploits. It is the most important
    task in the vulnerability management strategy, and if it is well executed, the
    vulnerability management is deemed to be a success. Activities in this task include
    identifying missing patches and checking for available upgrades to all systems
    in an organization. Solutions are also identified for the bugs that were picked
    up by scanning tools. Multiple layers of security, such as antivirus programs
    and firewalls, are also identified at this stage. If this phase is unsuccessful,
    it makes the whole vulnerability management process pointless.

  zh: 修复开始了真正结束漏洞管理周期的过程。正如之前所讨论的，漏洞管理阶段在分析了威胁和漏洞并概述了可接受的风险后，提前结束了。修复通过提出对已识别的威胁和漏洞的解决方案来补充这一过程。所有受影响的主机、服务器和网络设备都被追踪，并制定必要的措施来消除漏洞，并防止其未来被利用。这是漏洞管理策略中最重要的任务，如果执行得当，漏洞管理将被认为是成功的。此任务中的活动包括识别缺失的补丁，并检查组织中所有系统的可用升级。同时，还会为扫描工具发现的漏洞提供解决方案。在这一阶段，还会识别多层次的安全防护措施，如防病毒程序和防火墙。如果这一阶段未能成功执行，那么整个漏洞管理过程将变得毫无意义。
- en: As expected, this phase sees a coming together of a great many challenges since
    it is the phase where all vulnerabilities have their solutions identified. The
    first challenge arises when reporting is partial and does not contain all the
    required information about the risks that the organization faces. A poorly written
    report may lead to poor remediation measures and thus leave the organization still
    exposed to threats. The lack of software documentation may also bring about challenges
    in this phase. The vendors or manufacturers of software often leave documentation
    that includes an explanation of how updating is to be done. Without it, it may
    prove hard to update bespoke software. Poor communication between software vendors
    and the organization may also bring about challenges when the patching of a system
    needs to be done. Lastly, remediation can be compromised by the lack of cooperation
    of the end users. Remediation may introduce downtimes to end users, something
    that they never want to experience.

  zh: 如预期的那样，这一阶段聚集了许多挑战，因为这是所有漏洞的解决方案被确定的阶段。第一个挑战出现在报告不完整，并未包含组织面临的所有风险信息时。一份写得不好的报告可能导致修复措施不到位，从而使组织依然面临威胁。缺乏软件文档也可能在这一阶段带来挑战。软件的供应商或制造商通常会留下包含如何进行更新的说明文档。如果没有这些文档，更新定制软件可能会变得非常困难。软件供应商和组织之间的沟通不畅，也可能在系统修补时带来挑战。最后，修复过程可能会因最终用户缺乏合作而受到影响。修复可能会导致系统停机，这是最终用户最不希望经历的。

- en: An incident happened when Microsoft announced the existence of the MS03-023
    and released a patch for it. Smaller organizations that have short response plans
    were able to patch their operating systems with an update shortly after the announcement.
    However, larger organizations that either lacked or have long response plans for
    their computers were heavily attacked by hackers. Hackers released the MS Blaster
    worm to attack the unpatched operating systems barely 26 days after Microsoft
    gave a working patch to its users. That was enough time for even big companies
    to patch their systems in totality. However, the lack of response plans or the
    use of long response plans caused some to fall victim to the worm. The worm caused
    network sluggishness or outage on the computers it infected. Another famous incident
    that happened quite recently was that of the WannaCry ransomware. It is the largest
    ever ransomware attack in history caused by a vulnerability allegedly stolen from
    the NSA called **Eternal Blue** (3). The attack started in May, but Microsoft
    had released a patch for the Eternal Blue vulnerability in March. However, it
    did not release a patch for older versions of Windows, such as XP (3). From March
    until the day the first attack was recognized, there was enough time for companies
    to patch their systems. However, most companies had not done so by the time the
    attack started because of poor response planning. If the attack had not been stopped,
    even more computers would have fallen victim.

    Blaster蠕虫来攻击那些未修补的操作系统。即便是大型公司，也有足够的时间完全修补他们的系统。然而，响应计划的缺乏或长期响应计划的使用导致一些公司成为了蠕虫的受害者。这个蠕虫使得感染的计算机网络变得迟缓或发生宕机。另一起最近发生的著名事件是WannaCry勒索病毒袭击。这是史上最大规模的勒索病毒攻击，源于一个据称从NSA窃取的漏洞，名为**Eternal
    Blue**（3）。这次攻击始于5月，但微软早在3月就发布了Eternal Blue漏洞的修补程序。然而，它并未为较老版本的Windows（如XP）发布修补程序（3）。从3月到首次发现攻击的那一天，企业有足够的时间来修补他们的系统。然而，由于响应计划不足，大多数公司在攻击开始时并未进行修补。如果攻击没有被遏制，更多的计算机可能会成为受害者。

- en: The challenges faced in this phase are many since it involves the actual engagement
    of end users and their machines. The first of these challenges is getting the
    appropriate communications out to the right people in time. When a patch is released,
    hackers are never slow in trying to find ways to compromise the organizations
    that do not install it. That is why a well-established communication chain is
    important. Another challenge is accountability. The organization needs to know
    who to hold accountable for not installing patches. At times, users may be responsible
    for canceling installations. In other instances, it may be the IT team that did
    not initiate the patching process in time. There should always be an individual
    that can be held accountable for not installing patches. The last challenge is
    the duplication of efforts. This normally occurs in large organizations where
    there are many IT security personnel. They may use the same response plan, but
    because of poor communication, they may end up duplicating each other's efforts
    while making very little progress.

    devices connected to an organization's network. They can also provide extensive
    details about a network, its physical topology, the configurations of the connected
    computers, and their licensing information. All these tools are provided to the

    5 章](d07abf73-093e-4004-b690-1aa70db11902.xhtml)《*系统妥协*》中都有讨论。最常用的漏洞扫描工具是 Nessus
    和 NMap（后者通过其脚本功能可以作为基础的漏洞工具使用）。NMap 非常灵活，可以配置以满足用户的特定扫描需求。它能够快速绘制新网络的地图，并提供关于网络上连接的资产及其漏洞的信息。
- en: Nessus can be thought of as an advancement of the Nmap scanner. This is because
    Nessus can perform an in-depth vulnerability assessment of the hosts connected
    to a network (9). The scanner will be able to determine their operating systems
    versions, missing patches, and the relevant exploits that can be used against
    the system. The tool also sorts the vulnerabilities according to their threat
    levels. Nessus is also highly flexible such that its users can write their own
    attack scripts and use them against a wide range of hosts on the network (9).
    The tool has its own scripting language to facilitate this. It is a great feature
    since, as was stated when we discussed the challenges faced in this step, many
    scanners do not find the perfect balance between a good interface and a high level
    of flexibility. There are other related tools that can also be used for scannings,
    such as Harris STAT, Foundstone's Foundscan, and Zenmap. Their functionalities
    are, however, similar to those of both Nessus and Nmap.

    还具有高度的灵活性，用户可以编写自己的攻击脚本，并将其应用于网络上各种主机（9）。该工具拥有自己的脚本语言，以便于这一操作。这是一个很棒的功能，因为正如我们在讨论此步骤面临的挑战时所提到的，许多扫描器未能在良好的界面和高度灵活性之间找到完美的平衡。还有其他相关工具也可以用于扫描，如
    Harris STAT、Foundstone 的 Foundscan 和 Zenmap。然而，它们的功能与 Nessus 和 Nmap 类似。

- en: The implementation of vulnerability management follows the stipulated strategy.
    The implementation starts with the creation of an asset inventory. This serves
    as a register of all the hosts in a network and also of the software contained
    in them. At this stage, an organization has to give a certain IT staff member
    the task of keeping this inventory updated. The asset inventory at the very least
    should show the hardware and software assets owned by an organization and their
    relevant license details. As an optional addition, the inventory should also show
    the vulnerabilities present in any of these assets. An up-to-date register will
    come in handy when the organization has to respond to vulnerabilities with fixes
    to all its assets. The aforementioned tools can properly handle the tasks that
    are to be carried out at this stage.

  zh: 漏洞管理的实施应按照既定策略进行。实施过程从创建资产清单开始。资产清单作为网络中所有主机的登记表，并记录其中的软件。在这一阶段，组织需要指派某位IT工作人员负责保持该清单的更新。资产清单至少应展示组织拥有的硬件和软件资产以及相关的许可证详细信息。作为可选项，清单还应显示这些资产中存在的漏洞。当组织需要通过修复所有资产来应对漏洞时，一个更新的清单将非常有用。前述工具能够有效处理在此阶段需要执行的任务。
- en: After the implementation of the asset inventory, the organization should pay
    attention to information management. The goal should be the setting up of an effective
    way to get information about vulnerabilities and cybersecurity incidents to the
    relevant people within the shortest time possible. The right people to whom to
    send firsthand information about security incidents are the computer security
    incident response teams. The tools that were described as being capable of facilitating
    this stage require the creation of mailing lists. The incident response team members
    should be on the mailing list that receives the alerts from an organization's
    security monitoring tools.

- en: There should be separate mailing lists created to allow other stakeholders of
    the organization to access this information once it has been confirmed. The appropriate
    actions that other stakeholders ought to take should also be communicated via
    the mailing lists. The most recommendable tool for this step, which is from Symantec,
    provides periodic publications to the users in an organization to keep them updated
    about global cybersecurity incidents. All in all, at the end of this stage, there
    should be an elaborate communication channel to incident responders and other
    users when there has been a breach of systems.

- en: Following the implementation of mailing lists for information management, there
    should be a risk assessment. Risk assessment should be implemented in the manner
    described in the vulnerability management strategy. It should begin with the identification
    of the scope. It should be followed by the collection of data about the existing
    policies and procedures that the organization has been using. Data concerning
    their compliance should also be collected. After it is collected, the existing
    policies and procedures should be analyzed so as to determine whether they have
    been adequate in safeguarding the security of the organization. After this, vulnerability
    and threat analysis should be done. The threats and vulnerabilities that the organization

    should also be fine-tuned to meet the needs of various audiences. There are audiences
    that might not understand the technical side of vulnerabilities, and it is, therefore,
    only fair that they get a simplified version of the reports. Remediation tracking
    should follow the reports. After the risks and vulnerabilities that the organization
    faces are identified, the appropriate people to remedy them should be stated.
    They should be assigned the responsibility for ensuring that all the risks and

    can get is a fast and effective dissemination of information to the relevant audience.
    One of the best methods for doing this is allowing employees to make the conscious
    effort of subscribing to mailing lists. Another one is to allow the incident response
    team to post its own reports, statistics, and advice on a website for the organization's
    users. The organization should also hold periodic conferences to discuss new vulnerabilities,
    virus strains, malicious activities, and social engineering techniques with users.
    It is best if all the users are informed about the threats that they may face
    and how to deal with them effectively. This has more impact than the mailing lists
    telling them to do technical things that they are not knowledgeable of. Lastly,
    the organization should come up with a standardized template of how all the security-related

- en: The risk assessment step is one of the most manually demanding stages of the
    vulnerability management life cycle. This is because there are not many commercial
    tools that can be used here. One of the best practices is to document the ways
    to review new vulnerabilities as soon as they appear. This will save a lot of
    time when it comes to mitigating them since the appropriate countermeasures will
    already be known. Another best practice is to publish the risk ratings to the
    public or at least to the organizational users. That information may spread and
    ultimately reach a person that will find it more useful. It is also recommended
    that you ensure that asset inventories are both available and updated at this
    stage so that all hosts in a network can be combed through during risk analysis.
    The incident response team in every organization should also publish a matrix
    for each tool that the organization has deployed to secure itself. Lastly, the
    organization should ensure that it has a strict change management process that

    This is because we saw that this step might introduce serious disruptions to an
    organization and might do actual damage to the hosts. Therefore, a lot of planning
    ahead needs to happen. Another best practice is to create custom policies to specific
    environments—that is the different operating systems of the organization's hosts.
    Lastly, the organization should identify the scanning tools that are best for
    its hosts. Some methods may be overkill where they do too much scanning and to

  zh: 结论
- en: Organizations are finding themselves under the pressure of being forced to react
    quickly to the dynamically increasing number of cybersecurity threats. Since the
    attackers have been using an attack life cycle, organizations have also been forced
    to come up with a vulnerability management life cycle. The vulnerability management
    life cycle is designed to counter the efforts made by the attackers in the quickest
    and most effective way. This chapter has discussed the vulnerability management
    life cycle in terms of the vulnerability management strategy. It has gone through
    the steps of asset inventory creation, the management of information flow, the
    assessment of risks, assessment of vulnerabilities, reporting and remediation,
    and finally the planning of the appropriate responses. It has explained the importance
    of each step in the vulnerability management phase and how each should be carried
    out. The asset inventory has been described as crucial to the strategy because
    it is the point where all the details about the hosts are listed to assist in
    a thorough sanitization of all machines that may have vulnerabilities. The critical
    function of the information management step in disseminating information in a
    fast and reliable way has also been highlighted, as well as the tools commonly
    used to achieve it. The risk identification and classification functions of the
    risk assessment step have also been discussed. The chapter has also discussed
    the identification of vulnerabilities in hosts in the vulnerability assessment
    phase. The roles played by reporting and remediation tracking to inform all stakeholders
    and follow up on remediation have also been touched upon. The chapter has also
    discussed the final execution of all responses in the response planning step.
    The best practices for completing each of the steps successfully have also been
    discussed.

  zh: 摘要
- en: This chapter has outlined the types of response that organizations are expected
    to provide against attackers. The previous chapters have discussed the attack
    life cycle and outlined the tools and techniques that attackers normally come
    packed with. From these tools and techniques, a life cycle capable of mitigating
    them was designed. This chapter has discussed an effective vulnerability management
    life cycle composed of six steps. Each of the steps is aimed at making the life
    cycle effective and thorough in mitigating the vulnerabilities that may be in
    an organization that attackers may exploit. The well-planned life cycle ensures
    that not a single host of an organizational network is left exposed to attackers.
    The life cycle also ensures that the organization ends up with a fully secured
    IT environment and that it is hard for attackers to find any vulnerabilities to
    exploit. This chapter has given a set of best practices for each step of the life
    cycle. These best practices are aimed at ensuring that the incident response teams
    and the IT staff members make an exhaustive use of each step to secure the organization.
    In the next chapter, you will learn about the importance of logs and how you can
    analyze them.

  zh: 本章概述了组织应对攻击者时需要提供的响应类型。前几章讨论了攻击生命周期，并概述了攻击者通常携带的工具和技术。基于这些工具和技术，设计了一个可以减轻攻击的生命周期。本章讨论了一个有效的漏洞管理生命周期，该生命周期由六个步骤组成。每个步骤旨在确保生命周期在减轻攻击者可能利用的组织漏洞方面既有效又全面。经过精心规划的生命周期确保组织网络中的每个主机都不会暴露在攻击者面前。该生命周期还确保组织最终拥有一个完全安全的IT环境，并且攻击者很难找到可以利用的漏洞。本章为生命周期的每个步骤提供了一套最佳实践。这些最佳实践旨在确保事故响应团队和IT工作人员充分利用每个步骤来确保组织的安全。在下一章中，您将学习日志的重要性以及如何分析它们。
