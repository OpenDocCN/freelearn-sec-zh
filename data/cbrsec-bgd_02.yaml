    were still being developed, were too pricey for hackers, and only a few people
    knew how to write code to do basic input/output functions. A researcher called
    Bob Thomas then discovered that it was possible to create a malicious program
    that could propagate from one computer to another and leave an annoying message.
    Following this discovery, another researcher modified the program so that it could
    become self-replicating. Essentially, he created the first computer worm. He then
    decided to build another program that could catch the malicious one and delete
    it from a computer, thus stopping it from replicating and spreading further. This
    was the world's first antivirus software.

    cybersecurity was initially designed as a response to a cyber threat. Legacy systems
    were built to secure organizations from known threats. After the discovery of
    a cyber threat, security experts would learn its unique execution or coding patterns.
    This information would be used to enable security systems to detect and stop the
    identified cyber threat. This tradition still continues up to the present day.

    effective. Individuals and organizations were meant to believe that having a single
    security system on a computer was good enough. These security systems were then

    tools were discovered that could be used by non-expert hackers. They were known
    as **exploit kits**, and hackers would either buy or rent them to attack their
    targets. This caused a lot of pressure on the cybersecurity industry to evolve.
    It was clear that the initial design of tools that could detect malicious software
    based on attack signatures did not foresee many hackers coming up with new ways
    to beat such security systems. With the introduction of exploit tools that could
    generate malware that could change its attack patterns to avoid detection, it

    to beat the existing security tools. They had already come up with techniques
    to evade security tools on networks. They had also come up with a new attack method
    called a **buffer overflow**. A buffer overflow is conducted mostly on client/server
    apps, where payloads are delivered with data specifically aimed to fill and write
    outside memory buffers. For instance, hackers would supply scripts to log in input
    fields in a client app, which would cause the server to import files. Since the
    server would be expecting just a few characters in the input field, the excess
    data would cause a buffer overflow, causing it to fail or function erroneously.

    cybersecurity tools for different types of threats on different attack landscapes.
    The move was aimed at creating a hardened security shield against organizations.
    This strategy came to be referred to as **defense in depth**. At the minimum,
    organizations had to have a firewall, an antivirus program, intrusion-detection
    systems, strong authentication on login platforms, and encryption of data. The
    strategy worked well against single-vectored attacks. Hackers who had bought exploit
    kits would fail to go through all layers of protection so as to breach an organization's
    security. Hackers who had been relying on using network vulnerabilities were finding
    an extra layer of security that they could not go through.

    could breach a network and stay hidden in the network for a long period without
    detection. Such types of attacks were referred to as **advanced persistent threats**.
    Hacking became a profession and cyber criminals were taking the time to study
    targeted systems and acquire the tools needed to attack them. Once an attack was
    successful, the attackers would maintain access to it as they stole or modified
    data. One of these incidences was the Stuxnet attack against a nuclear fuel enrichment
    facility in Iran. The attackers, believed to have been state-sponsored, breached
    the security systems of the facility and stayed hidden in their networks for a
    long time. The malware collected enough information to determine how to carry
    out the attack that caused the destruction of the facility. This attack was most
    significant due to the zero-day vulnerabilities it used and the fact that the
    attacked computers were not even connected to the internet.

    Phishing was initially popular when members of the public were just getting computers
    and access to the internet for the first time. However, the phishing attacks of
    that time were quite rudimentary. The most common one was called the **Nigerian
    Prince scam**. It was an email sent to many people highlighting the tribulations
    of a purported Nigerian prince trying to get his inheritance money, but who needed
    some assistance to do so. Mostly, the targets were being asked to send some money
    to help clear the money. The scam gained popularity, before becoming less effective
    after it was publicized. However, 2011 saw a new wave of phishing attacks that
    were more sophisticated. The attempts shifted from simply trying to trick internet
    users into sending small amounts of money. Hackers started cloning legitimate
    company websites and email templates and informing them that there was a problem
    with the user accounts created with these companies. Users were being offered
    to rectify the issue by logging into given links. On the cloned websites, users
    would give out their real credentials and the hackers would use these credentials
    to steal data or money or gain access to sensitive systems.

- en: After this, **Denial of Service** (**DoS**) attacks also came into the spotlight.
    The increased number of personal computers on the internet that did not have sufficient
    security systems was a blessing to hackers. They would install malware in such
    computers that would recruit them into a network of zombie computers, called a
    **botnet**. These zombie computers would be commanded by the hackers to send illegitimate

    Cyber resilience was adopted to keep business operations going during and after
    cyber attacks. The end goal of having security changed from simply protecting
    the organization from attacks, to ensuring that business functions would not be
    severely interrupted by attacks. Businesses paid more attention to having ready

    industry was facing. This was the reporting of false positives. Initially, cybersecurity
    tools were just made to be more thorough in checking malicious programs and activities.
    It reached a point that they were so thorough, they were reporting harmless programs
    and activities as security threats. This was most common in network security tools,
    which were becoming highly inefficient in determining and separating actual threats
    from activities that had a small resemblance to threats. False positives were
    making the security tools unreliable. Network and security admins had to ignore
    many would-be threats, and sometimes, they would ignore legitimate threats in
    the process. The introduction of anomaly-based security tools ensured that the
    detected threats were real threats and needed to be stopped.

    cybersecurity tools had to check with many signatures, and this slowed down the
    performance of networks and systems. Anomaly-based tools did not have to refer
    to a signatures database. Instead, they did real-time analysis to check whether
    traffic or apps had abnormal behavior. Lastly, anomaly-based threats countered
    many social engineering attacks. On the network, these tools were capturing the
    packet headers to read origin and destination IP addresses and thus allow in traffic
    from known sources. Traffic from unknown sources was being subjected to thorough
    checks to find more details, such as whether the origin had been blacklisted or
    reported by other security tools to be malicious.

- en: AI/ML in cybersecurity involves deploying self-sufficient tools that can detect,

    is done based on the training that the algorithm in the security tool will have
    undertaken on its own, and the data already supplied by the developers. Therefore,
    throughout its life cycle, an AI-powered security tool will become better at detecting
    threats. The original dataset of threats provided by developers will provide reference
    base that it can use to know what is normal and what is malicious. The security
    tool will then be exposed to insecure environments before final deployment. In
    the environments filled with threats, the system will continually learn based
    on the threats that it detects or stops. Hacking attempts will also be directed
    at it. These attempts will involve hacking or attempts to overwhelm its processing
    capabilities with lots of malicious traffic. The tool will learn the most commonly
    used hacking techniques for breaching systems or networks. For instance, it will
    detect the use of password-cracking tools such as **Aircrack-ng** on wireless
    networks. Similarly, it will detect brute-force attacks on login interfaces. The

    systems are usually unable to detect threats that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.

    the malware and predict the outcome. Outcomes that are deemed to be harmful will
    cause the AI system to prevent the program from executing. Even if the malware
    obfuscates its code, the AI system will keep tabs on the execution pattern. It

    of operations played by AI systems is still limited. However, when AI finally
    overtakes human intelligence, the results of a failure in the systems might be
    intolerable. Since the security systems will be better than humans, it is possible
    that they will be in a position to refuse input from humans. A malfunctioning
    system might, therefore, continue operating without any interventions. The perfectionist
    nature of AI will be both good and bad. Current security systems work toward reducing
    the number of attacks that can succeed against a system. However, AI systems work
    toward eliminating all threats. Therefore, false-positive detection might not

  zh: 总结
- en: This chapter has looked at the evolution of cybersecurity from legacy to advanced
    and then on to futuristic technologies such as AI and ML. It has been explained
    that the first cybersecurity system was an antivirus system that was created to
    stop the first worm. Cybersecurity then followed this example, where security
    tools were created as responses to threats. Legacy security systems started the
    approach of using signature-based detection. This is where security tools would
    be loaded with signatures of common malware and use this knowledge base to detect
    and stop any program that matched the signature. However, the security systems
    were focused on malware, and thus, hackers focused on breaching organizations
    through the network. In 1970, an OS company was breached via its network and a
    copy of an OS was stolen. In 1990, the US military suffered a similar attack where
    a hacker broke into 97 computers and corrupted them. Therefore, the cybersecurity
    industry came up with stronger network security tools. However, these tools still
    used the signature-based approach and thus could not be trusted to keep all attacks
    at bay.

- en: In the 2000s, the cybersecurity industry came up with a new concept of security
    where it advised organizations to have layered security. Therefore, they had to
    have security systems for securing networks, computers, and data. However, layered
    security was quite expensive, yet some threat vectors were still infiltrating
    computers and networks. By 2010, cyber criminals started using threats called
    **advanced persistent threats**. Attackers were no longer doing hit-and-run attacks;
    they were infiltrating networks and staying hidden in the networks while carrying
    out malicious activities. In addition to this, phishing was revolutionized and
    made more effective. Lastly, there was another development where attackers were
    using DoS attacks to overwhelm the capabilities of servers and firewalls. Since
    many companies were being forced out of business by these attacks, the cybersecurity
    industry developed a new approach to security, known as **cyber resilience**.
    Instead of focusing on how to secure the organization during attacks, they ensured
    that organizations could survive the attacks. In addition to this, users became
    more involved in cybersecurity where organizations started focusing on training
    them to avoid common threats. This marked the end of security 1.0.

    it finally created an alternative to signature-based security systems. Anomaly-based
    security systems were introduced and they came with more efficiencies and capabilities
    than signature-based systems. Anomaly-based systems detect attacks by checking
    normal patterns or behaviors against anomalies. Apps and traffic that conform
    to the normal patterns and behaviors are allowed to execute or pass, while those
    that do not are stopped. While anomaly-based tools are effective, they rely on
    decisions from humans. Therefore, a lot of work still comes back to IT security

    deployment, these systems will be extensively trained using datasets and real
    environments that have real threats. Once the learning module is able to provide
    sufficient information to protect an organization from common threats, it will
    be deployed. One of the main advantages of AI security systems is that they will
    evolve along with the threats. Any new threats will be studied and thwarted. Despite
    the advantages of AI-powered security systems, there are worries that they may
    ultimately become harmful. As AI overtakes human intelligence, there might come
    a point where such tools will not accept any human input. There are also worries
    that attackers might poison the algorithms to make them harmful. Therefore, the
    future of AI in cyber security is not easy to foretell, but there should be two

    安全系统的主要优势之一是它们将随威胁的发展而演化。任何新的威胁将会被研究并加以阻止。尽管 AI 驱动的安全系统具有优势，但仍有人担心它们最终可能会变得有害。随着人工智能超越人类智能，可能会有一个时刻，这些工具不再接受任何人工输入。也有担心攻击者可能会毒化算法，使其变得有害。因此，人工智能在网络安全中的未来难以预测，但应该有两种主要结果：要么
