    to reduce risk related to IT systems. This includes the entire life cycle, from
    initially discovering vulnerabilities through reporting them, prioritizing them
    according to business needs, remediating them through software or procedural changes,
    verifying that they have been fixed, and documenting lessons learned for the future.

- en: Note that vulnerability management is not a one-time event. It's an ongoing
    process that needs to be revisited regularly. New vulnerabilities are discovered
    all the time, and old ones are fixed or become irrelevant. You need to make sure
    your systems are always up-to-date and that your patches are current.

- en: A vulnerability assessment is a systematic review of security weaknesses in
    an information system. Specifically, it looks for vulnerabilities in computer
    systems, applications, and network infrastructures. It evaluates if the system
    is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those
    vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation, if and whenever it's needed.

  zh: 漏洞可以分为以下几类：
- en: '**Misconfiguration**: You''ll hear me preach about this all the time because
    it''s one of the most common vulnerabilities. Misconfiguration is caused by human
    error. It allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to your systems. There
    are different types of misconfigurations because they could happen on application
    platforms, databases, the network itself, and even web servers. As misconfiguration
    could occur because someone may have forgotten to update the application or the
    database. They may have disabled the security settings or some features that are
    needed, or they may have gone set up permissions incorrectly or misconfigured
    SSL certificates.'

  zh: '**配置错误**：我总是强调这一点，因为它是最常见的漏洞之一。配置错误是由人为失误引起的，它使攻击者能够未经授权访问你的系统。配置错误有多种类型，因为它可能发生在应用平台、数据库、网络本身甚至是
    Web 服务器上。配置错误可能是因为某人忘记更新应用程序或数据库，禁用了所需的安全设置或某些功能，或者他们错误地设置了权限或错误配置了 SSL 证书。'
- en: '**Default installation vulnerabilities**: These are typically done when we
    hit the *Next* options during installation. I get it. Sometimes, this happens.
    Installing an application where the attackers and everybody else are expecting
    it to be and using the same directory structure can create a vulnerability.'

- en: '**Buffer overflows**: These are common software vulnerabilities, and they happen
    because of coding errors. What typically happens here is the attacker undermines
    the functionality of the program and tries to take control of the system by writing
    content beyond the allocated buffer size. If you overload the buffer, you end
    up creating a vulnerability, which could be anything from a system crash, the
    system becoming unstable, or even allowing some programs to do things they normally
    wouldn''t do.'

- en: '**The server''s operating system**: Not patching the server''s **operating
    system** (**OS**) appropriately may cause a vulnerability. Attackers are always

    data validation processes; either the communication or the backend of an app or
    even a bad design flaw within the network infrastructure itself.'

- en: '**Default passwords**: It cracks me up how many times people continue to use
    default passwords on devices, software, or the OS itself. The reason these are
    vulnerabilities is that if somebody just wants to get the application installed,
    they just hit next and take the defaults, and then in those defaults is the default
    password. They think, "*Oh, I''ll change it later*" and then they forget, move
    on from the project, get fired, or someone else takes over. Whatever the case,

- en: One of the reasons some companies skip using a **vulnerability management program**
    (**VMP**) is that they often think that the devices or services they are currently
    using are already protecting them. However, we must remember that a firewall strictly
    does what a firewall is supposed to do, which is to accept or allow connections
    through, based on the ports or the protocols they are using. The same applies
    to an antivirus program. It will scan documents or files within our systems to
    make sure they haven't been infected. We may also have an intrusion detection
    system in place, but again, that's only looking for active connections.
  id: totrans-25

  zh: 一些公司跳过使用**漏洞管理程序**(**VMP**)的原因之一是，他们通常认为他们当前使用的设备或服务已经在保护他们。然而，我们必须记住，防火墙严格执行它应当做的工作，即根据端口或协议的使用情况来允许或拒绝连接。抗病毒程序也是一样，它会扫描我们系统中的文档或文件，确保它们没有被感染。我们可能还会有入侵检测系统，但同样，它仅仅是在寻找活跃的连接。
- en: However, a VMP looks at the network devices, servers, workstations, and mobile
    devices and pinpoints weaknesses that need to be fixed or patched. Hopefully,
    they do this before they get breached. With close to 100 vulnerabilities being
    announced each week, your organization's network is only as secure as its last
    vulnerability assessment.

- en: One of the problems preventing organizations from using a VMP is that the vulnerability
    scans and the reports they get, as well as the remediation process, can be extremely
    overwhelming. However, if you look at this from a different perspective, if your
    team is on top of the remediation process and the scans, those reports will become
    less intimidating because you're going to be more on top of things.

- en: A VMP can help identify which risks need to be repaired or fixed. If we thoroughly
    monitor activity, we will get more information about the systems on our network.
    This allows us to contextualize all the different nodes or systems listed within
    the scan report itself. They can make better assessments about what needs to be
    fixed, when, and how. They also get to know which risks are extremely pressing
    versus those that aren't as important.

  zh: VMP可以帮助识别需要修复或修补的风险。如果我们彻底监控活动，我们将获得关于网络中系统的更多信息。这使我们能够将扫描报告中列出的不同节点或系统进行上下文化分析。这样，我们可以更好地评估哪些问题需要修复、何时修复以及如何修复。它们还可以帮助我们区分哪些风险是极其紧迫的，而哪些则不那么重要。
- en: Time is money. Some argue it takes too much time to perform vulnerability scans
    and the remediation process. They forget to compare it to the amount of time they
    spend remediating huge risks that are detected too late or, worse, having to deal
    with bad press right from the fallout of some type of breach in their environment.
    By looking at these reports and monitoring what's going on, it becomes clear that

  zh: 我们的漏洞扫描器或漏洞管理平台（VMP）可以进行不同类型的扫描，具体如下：
- en: '**Active scan/non-credentialed scans**: This scan proceeds by directing test
    packets at a host without being able to log onto the OS or application. What we
    get out of this is a specific view that allows us to see what the host exposes
    to the network. These are also referred to as remote scans. Now, even though you''re
    doing a non-credential scan, you could put include things such as default passwords
    for service accounts in devices. Active scanning also consumes more network bandwidth
    and runs the risk of crashing a target of the scan, causing some weird results,
    or even an outage.'

- en: '**Passive scans**: A passive scanner watches network traffic, usually through
    a mirrored port, and tries to identify the policy definition or the CVEs. This
    type of scanning has the least amount of impact on the network because it''s simply
    sitting there listening, as opposed to a credential scan. This is where you give
    a user an account with login rights to various hosts. You can specify a username
    and password. This gives you in-depth analysis, especially when you''re detecting
    when an application or security settings could be misconfigured. It also helps
    demonstrate if an attacker has compromised one of your user accounts.'

  zh: '**被动扫描**：被动扫描器通过镜像端口监控网络流量，并试图识别策略定义或已知漏洞（CVE）。这种扫描对网络的影响最小，因为它只是静静地监听，而不是进行凭证扫描。在凭证扫描中，你为用户提供一个账户，允许其登录多个主机，并可以指定用户名和密码。这为你提供了深入分析，特别是在检测应用程序或安全设置可能存在配置错误时。它还帮助你证明攻击者是否已经入侵了某个用户账户。'
- en: '**Agent scans**: This type of scan is where we install an agent on the different
    stations or targets that we plan on scanning. The agent is simply a piece of software
    that reports back to a specific server or service and is managed by an administration
    server. It runs the scans locally and then sends the report at a set schedule
    to the administrative server. Nessus is a VMP that has an agent that you can install
    on a Windows host. The biggest advantage here is that agent-based scans help reduce
    the impact on your network since everything is being done by the agent on the
    local machine and only the results are reported back. However, one of the drawbacks
    is that the range of agents could be limited to a particular OS, but most of them
    today support all the major OSs. The other disadvantage would be that this is
    now another application that you, as a security professional, need to make sure
    the agents are up to date with so that an attacker can''t compromise it and use
    it to get into your environment.'

    是一个虚拟机器平台（VMP），它有一个可以安装在 Windows 主机上的代理程序。这里的最大优势是，基于代理的扫描有助于减少对网络的影响，因为所有操作都由本地机器上的代理执行，只有结果被报告回去。然而，一个缺点是代理的范围可能仅限于特定的操作系统，但如今大多数代理都支持所有主要的操作系统。另一个缺点是，这将是一个新的应用程序，作为安全专业人员，你需要确保这些代理是最新的，以防攻击者利用它们进入你的环境。'

  zh: 另一个问题是扫描器可能在使用启发式分析，这可能会因为网络使用的有效变化而产生混淆。换句话说，可能需要建立新的基准来参考。
- en: Another issue that may pop up is that you might be running scans that aren't
    appropriate for your network – for example, running an application vulnerability
    scan when your network doesn't run that application. One of the things you should
    do is try adjusting the scope of the scan so that you are testing for the appropriate
    applications within your network infrastructure.

  zh: 另一个可能出现的问题是，你可能正在运行一些不适合你网络的扫描——例如，在你的网络中并未运行该应用时进行应用漏洞扫描。你应该做的其中一件事是尝试调整扫描的范围，以确保你只对网络基础设施中的相关应用进行测试。
- en: Finally, we have the issue that the scanner might be identifying vulnerabilities
    that could be exploited with administrative privileges, and not by end users.
    Now, one of the cool things you can do – especially with most of the VMPs out
    there – to reduce the incidence of false positives you get is identify the exception
    in the scan and configure it in a template. This may mean that you're going to
    exclude certain hosts from certain types of scans or continue to report the vulnerability
    but just assign it a lower priority. If you have systems that can't be patched
    or remediated, then you may want to watch those systems a little more closely.

  zh: 最后，我们面临的问题是扫描仪可能会识别出一些可以通过管理员权限而非最终用户来利用的漏洞。现在，你可以做的一件酷事——尤其是针对市面上大多数的VMP（虚拟化管理平台）——就是通过识别扫描中的例外情况并将其配置到模板中来减少误报的发生。这可能意味着你将排除某些主机不进行某些类型的扫描，或者继续报告该漏洞但将其优先级降低。如果你有无法修补或修复的系统，那么你可能需要更密切地监视这些系统。

    number of logins, the failure of logins, active ports, the number of authorized
    or unauthorized devices on your network, unauthorized software, and so on. These
    types of stats may only be interesting from a security perspective and that's
    because most networks will change – that is, they will get faster as they deploy
    new equipment and new cabling. You should focus on training as well as threat
    awareness education – how well is your staff informed about cyber threats? You
    can measure the number of programs or start grading your users based on their
    knowledge. We see a lot of this today with the companies that help you create
    emails that are designed for users to click on a link, and then a trunk monkey
    pops out and smacks them on the head.

- en: Looking at compliance. This is great – you've got all these rules and policies

    looking for? When I get up in the morning and I start reviewing all my security
