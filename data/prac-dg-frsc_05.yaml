- en: This chapter highlights the rapidly changing forensic environment, where conventional
    forensic imaging and indexing of increasingly larger datasets is becoming unviable.
    It introduces new forensic processes and tools to assist in more sound recovery
    of evidence and better use of resources. The chapter introduces the advent of
    **disruptive technology** that is challenging the established digital forensic
    response and overreliance on forensic specialists, who are themselves becoming
    swamped with heavier caseloads and limited ability to process larger and disparate
    datasets.

    in the government and private sectors to meet the growing demand for qualified
    practitioners. Many of these entrants to the discipline gain employment with forensic
    laboratories now undertaking digital forensic examinations. More recently, budgetary
    constraints are affecting many digital forensics laboratories, which have seriously
    restricted staffing numbers and specialist training. At the same time, the dramatic
    increase of laboratories' caseloads can have a detrimental effect on the soundness

    auditors to investigate, who in turn require the expertise of practitioners to
    locate and analyze relevant digital evidence. This has placed an extra burden

    have digital forensic laboratories, for they are expensive and require experienced
    personnel who are not always readily available. It is more common for organizations
    to integrate digital forensics as a part of security-incident response programs.
    Digital forensic examinations can be costly in terms of time and manpower, as
    are the laboratories that provide these services. Law enforcement agencies, defense
    and intelligence agencies, larger financial institutions, and international accounting

    storage of images for the sake of it not only costs storage space, time, money,
    and management but also security, and it poses a potential risk of escalating
    data requests outside the bounds of the case at hand as well. An investigation
    that starts on one track might inadvertently find sufficient tangents of data

    archives results in slower searches and missed files. Many organizations have
    complained about significant difficulties managing indexes, notably, a requirement
    to re-index broken archives periodically, thereby negating any risk-mitigation
    benefit. Concerns have also been raised as to the ability of index-based e-discovery
    tools to locate key files subject to privilege. Checking samples of large e-mail

    sets to be filtered and cataloged efficiently so as to reduce the time spent on

    Moreover, while the administrator may be able to isolate a user and e-mail accounts,
    the possibility remains that information of value may be overlooked in other locations
    on the server not evident to the examining team. The team may lack sufficient
    technical knowledge and experience regarding the less likely locations of evidence.

- en: The chapter further described the challenges posed by the rapidly increasing
    size of datasets that makes it difficult to seek digital evidence without considerable
    expenditure of time, money, and human resources. The questionability of conventional
    forensic image protection has also been highlighted. The continuing use of forensic
    imaging is predicted to become less prevalent because of the concomitant increase
    in the size of secure data stores to preserve the evidence and related resource
    costs. The use of better tools to process large datasets, identify important evidence,
    and preserve it in more modest storage sizes is urgently needed.

    value through testing and casework, confirming its effectiveness in overcoming
    challenges posed to practitioners, with some encouraging results being observed.
    Such processes offered in the suite of tools should attract the attention of practitioners,
    not just in the e-discovery field, but also in law enforcement and the intelligence
    community—communities facing escalating costs, reduced manpower, and limited time
    to process information in a timely manner. Information managers and the legal
    fraternity also seek some autonomy from costly specialists and vendors to better
