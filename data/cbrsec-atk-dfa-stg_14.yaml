- en: The previous chapter looked at how an attack can be investigated to understand
    the cause and prevent a similar attack in the future. However, an organization
    cannot fully depend on protecting itself from attacks and all the risks that it
    faces. The organization is exposed to a wide range of disasters such that it is
    impossible to have protective measures against them. The causes of a disaster
    to the IT infrastructure can either be natural or man-made. Natural disasters
    are ones that result from environmental hazards or acts of nature. These include
    blizzards, wildfires, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, lightning
    strikes, and even asteroids falling from the sky and impacting the ground. Man-made
    disasters are ones that arise from the actions of human users or external human
    actors. They include fires, cyber warfare, nuclear explosions, hacking, power
    surges, and accidents, among others.

    Critical systems are defined as systems that are required to support the different

    priorities is to list the critical needs of each department, identify the key
    processes that need to take place in order to meet them, and then identify and

    of money and even led to deaths when it encrypted computers used for sensitive
    functions. This is one of the many dynamic changes that affect IT infrastructures
    and force organizations to quickly adapt. Therefore, a good disaster recovery
    plan must be updated often (3). Most of the organizations hit by WannaCry were
    unprepared for it and had no idea what actions  they should have taken. The attack
    only lasted a few days, but caught many organizations unaware. This clearly shows
    that disaster recovery plans should be updated based on need rather than on a
    rigid schedule. Therefore, the last step in the disaster recovery process should
    be the setting up of an updating schedule. This schedule should also make provisions
    for updates to be done when they are needed, too.

    Another challenge is the incompleteness of the **recovery time objective** (**RTO**)
    that DR teams come up with. RTOs are the key determiners of the maximum acceptable
    downtime for an organization. It is at times difficult for the DR team to come
    up with a cost-effective plan that is within the RTO. Lastly, there is the challenge
    of outdated plans. The IT infrastructure dynamically changes in its attempts to
    counter the threats that it faces. Therefore, it is a huge task to keep the disaster
    recovery plan updated, and some organizations fail to do this. Outdated plans
    may be ineffective and may be unable to recover the organization when disasters
    caused by new threat vectors happen.

    recovery mechanisms mean that the affected system has to be taken offline, some

    are some organizations that have systems that cannot enjoy the luxury of being
    taken offline for recovery to be done. There are other systems that are structurally
    built in a way that they cannot be brought down for recovery. In both instances,
    a live recovery has to be done. A live recovery can be done in two ways. The first
    involves a clean system with the right configurations and uncorrupted backup files
    being installed on top of the faulty system. The end result is that the faulty
    system is gotten rid of, together with its files, and a new one takes over.

- en: The second type of live recovery is where data recovery tools are used on a
    system that is still online. The recovery tools may run an update on all the existing
    configurations to change them to the right ones. It may also replace faulty files
    with recent backups. This type of recovery is used when there is some valuable
    data that is to be recovered in the existing system. It allows for the system
    to be changed without affecting the underlying files. It also allows recovery
    to be done without doing a complete system restore. A good example is the recovery
    of Windows using a Linux live CD. The live CD can do many recovery processes,
    thereby saving the user from having to install a new version of Windows and thus
    losing all the existing programs (4). The live CD can, for instance, be used to
    reset or change a Windows PC password. The Linux tool used to reset or change
    passwords is called `chntpw`. An attacker does not need any root privileges to
    perform this. The user needs to boot the Windows PC from an Ubuntu live CD and
    install `chntpw` (4). The live CD will detect the drives on the computer and the
    user will just have to identify the one containing the Windows installation.

    Live CD恢复Windows。Live CD可以执行许多恢复过程，从而避免了用户安装新的Windows版本并丢失所有现有程序（4）。例如，Live CD可以用于重置或更改Windows
    PC密码。用于重置或更改密码的Linux工具叫做`chntpw`。攻击者不需要任何root权限就可以执行此操作。用户需要从Ubuntu Live CD启动Windows
    PC并安装`chntpw`（4）。Live CD将检测计算机上的驱动器，用户只需识别包含Windows安装的驱动器。

    risks significantly. There are many risks that face organizations, ranging from
    natural disasters to the careless actions of users. The impacts that these risks
    may cause range from mild, such as disk failures, to severe impacts, such as the
    physical destruction of a server farm. Even though organizations tend to dedicate

    outage times depending on their core business processes. An e-commerce shop, for
    instance, has less maximum allowable outage time for its network compared to a
    manufacturing industry. The organization needs to keenly observe its key processes

    as to determine when a disaster is occurring early enough and to start the recovery
    process. Organizations should also implement fault-tolerant systems that can withstand
    a certain degree of exposure to a disaster. Implementing a **redundant array of
    independent disks** (**RAID**) for servers is one way of achieving redundancy.
    It is also good to test the integrity of the backups that are made to ensure that
    they have no errors. It would be disappointing for an organization to realize
    after a disaster that its backups have errors and are useless. Lastly, the organization

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we have discussed ways in which organizations prepare to ensure
    business continuity during disasters. We have talked about the disaster recovery
    planning process. We have highlighted what needs to be done to identify the risks
    faced, prioritize the critical resources to be recovered, and determine the most
    appropriate recovery strategies. In this chapter, we have also discussed the live
    recovery of systems while they remain online. We have focused a lot on contingency
    planning, and discussed the entire contingency planning process, touching on how
    a reliable contingency plan needs to be developed, tested, and maintained.
